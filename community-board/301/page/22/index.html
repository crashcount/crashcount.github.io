E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Ossé stated, 'They brought this to the community board and there was an outpouring of support for this protected bike lane.' The matter was discussed with Community Boards 3 and 8, and local officials, schools, and businesses support the project. Council Member Lincoln Restler accused Mayor Adams of putting politics over public safety, saying, 'Mayor Adams has decided that he cares more about who he thinks is going to vote for him in 2025 than our lives.' The delay leaves cyclists exposed to ongoing danger, with injuries on the rise. The DOT’s call for more 'community engagement' is seen as a smokescreen for inaction.

Sixty violations. No real punishment. Council Member Restler demands action. Oversight is weak. Dangerous trucks roam free. Pedestrians pay the price. The company stays silent. The city looks away.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned Manolos Trucking after two fatal pedestrian crashes in New York City within six months. The company racked up over 60 reckless driving tickets—red lights, speeding, more. The Business Integrity Commission issued six violations since 2019. Yet, penalties remain minimal: a small fine for a hood ornament, missing paperwork. The driver in the latest fatality faces no charges, despite video showing the pedestrian had the right of way. Restler declared, 'We need much stricter oversight of the private sanitation and construction truck companies that are operating in New York City.' He added, 'Companies like Manolos Trucking should not be allowed to do business in New York City.' The company did not respond to requests for comment. Oversight is lax. Dangerous trucks keep rolling. Vulnerable New Yorkers keep dying.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
