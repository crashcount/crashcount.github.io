Forty-seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In three and a half years, the count keeps rising. Cyclists, children, elders. No one is spared.</p><p>A man on a bike, helmet strapped, is thrown and killed on Lynch Street. A child is crushed by a dump truck turning left on Withers. A pedestrian is struck dead by a speeding e-bike on India Street. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main killers.</strong> They took four lives. Trucks alone killed three. Bikes and e-bikes killed two. Mopeds and motorcycles, another two. The rest are left broken—bones, heads, lives. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>: cars and trucks caused the most harm, but every mode can kill when the street is built for speed and chaos.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have put their names on bills. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez and Lincoln Restler co-sponsored laws to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for citywide daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee, waiting. The city promises, but the street stays the same.</p><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called out the city’s failure to act: “I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>She urged the mayor to stay the course</a>. Still, the dead keep coming.</p><p>A neighbor saw the aftermath: “He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>The driver had a mask. He hit the guy and he left.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The street can be changed. The bills can move. The crosswalks can be cleared. The speed can be slowed. But only if you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylight at every corner, protected lanes, and a street that does not kill.</strong> The silence of leaders is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous.

Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.'

The city stalls.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-03-31) reports a deadly crash on Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn. Miriam Yarimi, driving on a suspended license, ran a red light, made an illegal turn, and struck the Saada family in a crosswalk. Natasha Saada and her daughters, ages 8 and 5, were killed; her son remains critical. Five others were injured. The article notes, 'They happen so frequently that it's not shocking anymore.' Ocean Parkway is notorious for reckless driving and has seen 15 deaths since 2017. Locals and advocates highlight confusing signals, poor bike lane upkeep, and repeated calls for redesign. The crash vehicle had 21 speed tickets since 2023. The city DOT cites jurisdictional limits, as Ocean Parkway is a state road, complicating safety upgrades.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
