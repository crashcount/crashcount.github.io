E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Council now holds the power. Lawmakers stall. Streets stay deadly. Victims’ families and advocates demand action. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, would let New York City lower speed limits below 25 mph. The bill failed to enter the 2023 state budget, shifting responsibility to the City Council. In 2021, the Council backed a home rule message 42-6, but the Assembly blocked it. Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing. The Council’s inaction keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At a rally, Restler said, "It is wrong how deadly this strip is." The officials demand mid-block crossings, daylighted intersections, raised crosswalks, curb extensions, and safer pedestrian space near BQE ramps. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized city resistance to reallocating street space, saying, "They drag their feet because they don’t want to do the inevitable." The Department of Transportation has agreed only to study new crosswalks. The bill is not yet formal legislation but marks a push for action after years of delay.

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of traffic calming devices in senior pedestrian zones.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the bill, joined by co-sponsors including Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, and others. The council voted overwhelmingly in favor on April 27, 2023. The law requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to annually install at least one traffic calming device in each designated senior pedestrian zone, with a minimum of fifty devices citywide per year. DOT must report installation locations to the council every year. The law aims to slow traffic and protect older pedestrians where they are most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, District 34, proposed a taskforce to study citywide e-bike charging stations, saying, 'E-bikes are here to stay.' She urged the city to 'keep New Yorkers safe' with exclusive charging points for delivery riders. The matter, titled 'Fire at Sunset Park e-bike store displaces 2 families as pols fight to regulate lithium-ion batteries,' highlights a deadly pattern: over 400 fires, 300 injuries, and 12 deaths from e-bike batteries in four years. The bill has no set vote date. Federal lawmakers also introduced the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act to regulate battery safety. The push aims to curb fires, protect homes, and shield vulnerable New Yorkers from battery explosions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would allow the public to submit photos of police vehicles parked on sidewalks and in bike lanes. The measure, highlighted in the matter title, responds to widespread complaints: 'cops have been told to stop parking illegally on sidewalks and in bike lanes.' Restler clashed with NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell over the issue. The bill’s status and committee assignment remain unlisted. Restler’s action—introducing and championing the bill—puts pressure on the NYPD to respect public space. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the bill’s intent is clear: reclaim sidewalks and bike lanes for those on foot and bike, not for parked police vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It slashes the waiting period for new bike lanes from months to weeks. DOT backs the move. Advocates say delays cost lives. The bill puts safety over bureaucracy. The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 417, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, was discussed at a City Council hearing on April 26, 2023. The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
