The driver turned, the cyclist went down. There was no protection—just paint on the road. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. The cyclist was left broken too. <em>“The road diet works where it’s been installed and it’s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,”</em> said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>8 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in Brooklyn CB1.

A 42-year-old man, crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A 49-year-old, killed by a bike on India Street. A 72-year-old, struck crossing Scholes and Union. Each one gone. Each one preventable.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept moving. Bikes and mopeds took lives too. No one is spared. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=promises-and-power>Promises and Power</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher stood up for the McGuinness redesign. She called out the opposition: <em>“I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.”</em> She urged the mayor to <em>“stay the course”</em> on safety <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>in a public statement</a>.</p><p>But the mayor did not. The city left two lanes for cars and painted lines for bikes. The road stayed wide. The danger stayed real.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a risk. Every promise broken is another family left to grieve.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The bill would codify 34 RCNY 4-12(j), making the ban law. Bottcher and co-sponsors want to cut visual clutter and driver distraction.
