Forty-seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In three and a half years, the count keeps rising. Cyclists, children, elders. No one is spared.</p><p>A man on a bike, helmet strapped, is thrown and killed on Lynch Street. A child is crushed by a dump truck turning left on Withers. A pedestrian is struck dead by a speeding e-bike on India Street. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main killers.</strong> They took four lives. Trucks alone killed three. Bikes and e-bikes killed two. Mopeds and motorcycles, another two. The rest are left broken—bones, heads, lives. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>: cars and trucks caused the most harm, but every mode can kill when the street is built for speed and chaos.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have put their names on bills. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez and Lincoln Restler co-sponsored laws to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for citywide daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee, waiting. The city promises, but the street stays the same.</p><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called out the city’s failure to act: “I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>She urged the mayor to stay the course</a>. Still, the dead keep coming.</p><p>A neighbor saw the aftermath: “He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>The driver had a mask. He hit the guy and he left.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The street can be changed. The bills can move. The crosswalks can be cleared. The speed can be slowed. But only if you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylight at every corner, protected lanes, and a street that does not kill.</strong> The silence of leaders is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way. The report states, 'A Dodge pickup turned left. A 49-year-old woman crossed in the marked crosswalk.
