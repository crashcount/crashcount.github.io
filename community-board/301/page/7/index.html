The driver turned, the cyclist went down. There was no protection—just paint on the road. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. The cyclist was left broken too. <em>“The road diet works where it’s been installed and it’s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,”</em> said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>8 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in Brooklyn CB1.

A 42-year-old man, crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A 49-year-old, killed by a bike on India Street. A 72-year-old, struck crossing Scholes and Union. Each one gone. Each one preventable.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept moving. Bikes and mopeds took lives too. No one is spared. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=promises-and-power>Promises and Power</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher stood up for the McGuinness redesign. She called out the opposition: <em>“I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.”</em> She urged the mayor to <em>“stay the course”</em> on safety <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>in a public statement</a>.</p><p>But the mayor did not. The city left two lanes for cars and painted lines for bikes. The road stayed wide. The danger stayed real.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a risk. Every promise broken is another family left to grieve.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The event, reported by Streetsblog NYC, was not a bill or vote but a personal shift. Sohn said, 'It disconnects you from the life of the city.' She praised Albany’s walkability and called car ownership a hassle. Governor Hochul also spoke on the need for walkable cities and announced a $400-million downtown plan. No committee, bill number, or formal legislative action is tied to this event. According to safety analysts, this is an individual choice and a vague policy gesture; without concrete legislative changes, there is no measurable system-wide safety impact for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bill forces reckless drivers to install speed limiters. Lawmakers act after years of carnage. Streets remain perilous for walkers and riders until the law takes hold.</p><p class=mb3>On May 21, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee advanced bill S4045B, known as the Stop Super Speeders bill. The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
