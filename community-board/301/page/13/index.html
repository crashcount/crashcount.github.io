The city's goal right now should be to prevent bad implementation from undermining a good bill."" -- Antonio Reynoso</p><p class=mb3>The 2019 commercial waste zone reform aimed to cut truck carnage by dividing New York City into 20 zones, each served by specific haulers. As of October 30, 2024, only one zone is active. No timeline exists for citywide rollout. The Department of Sanitation claims caution is needed to avoid price hikes and ensure effective change, but offers no clear metrics or deadlines. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, pleads, 'We can't wait another day to enforce truck safety requirements.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso warns, 'The city's goal right now should be to prevent bad implementation from undermining a good bill.' Delays keep streets deadly for workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The law’s promise remains unfulfilled. Vulnerable New Yorkers remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move targets SUVs and trucks that kill and injure New Yorkers. Sponsors say the law will cut deaths, push smaller cars, and clear the air. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0601-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced October 10, 2024, it urges Albany to pass S.6657A/A.7978. The resolution calls for 'amend[ing] the Vehicle and Traffic Law, in relation to registration fees for certain vehicles.' Council Members Justin L. Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor, District 33) lead the charge. The bill would raise registration fees for larger, heavier vehicles, with a break for electric car batteries. The resolution cites grim numbers: 103 pedestrians killed in New York City in 2023, and research showing heavy vehicles are deadlier. The Council says this law could deter the spread of oversized cars, protect people on foot and bike, and cut emissions.
