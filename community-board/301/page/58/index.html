Fifty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Three thousand two hundred eighty injured since 2022. The streets run through <a href=/neighborhood/bk0101/>Greenpoint</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bk0102/>Williamsburg</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bk0103/>South Williamsburg</a>, and <a href=/neighborhood/bk0104/>East Williamsburg</a>. The pain is not spread evenly. It hits the young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><p><strong>Just this spring, a 49-year-old man was killed by an unlicensed e-bike rider on India Street.</strong> A child died under the wheels of a dump truck turning left on Withers Street. A cyclist was crushed between SUVs on Flushing Avenue. These are not isolated tragedies. They are the drumbeat of daily life here.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A sister-in-law spoke after a recent death: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo;</a> The grief is sharp, the loss permanent. Days after the crash, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;circular tire tracks were still visible in the parking lot.&rdquo;</a> The marks do not fade. Neither does the pain.</p><h3 id=who-is-responsible>Who Is Responsible?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main killers.</strong> They caused 385 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses took 56 more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. No street is safe until every driver is held to account.</p><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/50/>Emily Gallagher</a> has pushed for speed limiters on repeat offenders and voted to extend school speed zones. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/18/>Julia Salazar</a> co-sponsored and voted for bills to curb repeat speeding. But the carnage continues. <strong>Every delay is another body in the road.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure to act. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Push for the Stop Super Speeders Act. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident highlights ongoing failures in city safety policy. The intersection is described as 'very dangerous,' with fast turns and drivers not yielding. Only 27 percent of the city’s 5,860 heavy garbage trucks have side guards, despite a 2019 city deal requiring them by 2024. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, then a Council Member, said, 'side rails should be installed sooner.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives called for 'bold action' and criticized city officials for delaying redesigns and safety steps. The private carting industry remains under scrutiny after repeated fatal crashes. No council bill number is attached, but the event underscores the urgent need for systemic change to protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Plastic posts failed. Cars park in the lane. Crashes mount. They want Jersey barriers, hardened entrances, and an end to chaos. The city must act before more lives are lost.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2022, North Brooklyn officials and activists sent a letter to the Department of Transportation demanding a true protected bike lane on Grand Street. The letter, backed by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and Council Members Lincoln Restler and Jennifer Gutierrez, called for 'protective jersey barricades and measures taken at each intersection to stop cars from entering the protected bike lane.' The group condemned the current plastic delineators, noting, 'From day one, the Grand Street bike lane has failed to keep people safe.' Since 2019, 67 cyclists have been injured and 196 crashes reported. The letter urges the city to replace weak barriers, fix dangerous entrances, and finally deliver safety for vulnerable road users. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Mayor Adams are now under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
