Forty-seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In three and a half years, the count keeps rising. Cyclists, children, elders. No one is spared.</p><p>A man on a bike, helmet strapped, is thrown and killed on Lynch Street. A child is crushed by a dump truck turning left on Withers. A pedestrian is struck dead by a speeding e-bike on India Street. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main killers.</strong> They took four lives. Trucks alone killed three. Bikes and e-bikes killed two. Mopeds and motorcycles, another two. The rest are left broken—bones, heads, lives. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>: cars and trucks caused the most harm, but every mode can kill when the street is built for speed and chaos.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have put their names on bills. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez and Lincoln Restler co-sponsored laws to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for citywide daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee, waiting. The city promises, but the street stays the same.</p><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called out the city’s failure to act: “I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>She urged the mayor to stay the course</a>. Still, the dead keep coming.</p><p>A neighbor saw the aftermath: “He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>The driver had a mask. He hit the guy and he left.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The street can be changed. The bills can move. The crosswalks can be cleared. The speed can be slowed. But only if you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylight at every corner, protected lanes, and a street that does not kill.</strong> The silence of leaders is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No direct safety impact noted.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1115-2023 was introduced on June 22, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill sought to amend city code by setting penalties for alternate side parking violations at $65 for a first offense and $100 for each subsequent offense within a 12-month period. After three violations in a year, the vehicle would be towed if found in violation again. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing penalties for alternate side parking violations and requiring towing of certain vehicles in violation of alternate side parking rules.' Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor) led the effort. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

Nydia Velázquez, and Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez urged state officials to join the city in seeking federal funding for the BQGreen park proposal. The plan would cap a stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in south Williamsburg, creating 3.5 acres of new parkland. Reynoso called on Governor Kathy Hochul to act as a co-applicant for funds, stating, "We're calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to be a co-applicant alongside the City of New York for federal funding to finally deck the BQE." Velázquez said, "We are fighting to reimagine the way to reconnect neighborhoods, improve traffic and reduce toxic pollution." Gutierrez stressed the urgent need for open space and clean air. The proposal, estimated at $100-200 million, is framed as an environmental justice effort to heal a community long divided and harmed by the highway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gallagher says, 'I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.' She urges the mayor to 'stay the course' on safe streets. Gallagher’s statement highlights the deadly toll of crashes on McGuinness and the urgent need for transformative change. Thousands of constituents support the redesign.

The program, managed by the Department of Transportation, will run on five Saturdays in July and August, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., covering 17 miles. Borough presidents Antonio Reynoso (Brooklyn) and Donovan Richards (Queens) pushed for this expansion, with Reynoso praising the use of major corridors like Eastern Parkway. Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing. The expansion marks a step forward, but the early end time leaves advocates wanting more.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The app would show locations, voltage, charging level, connector types, e-bike compatibility, and real-time availability. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the creation of a mobile application that provides information about electric vehicle charging stations.' Council Member Keith Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, Cabán, Farías, Riley, Richardson Jordan, Ossé, Ung, Hanif, Restler, and Gutiérrez.

The event followed the removal of traffic calming measures, which had once protected pedestrians and cyclists. Chris Roberti, chair of the Safe Streets Committee at Public School 110, called for a 'comprehensive, safe street redesign.' Council Member Lincoln Restler promised to 'push like all hell' for changes at Monitor and Driggs by September. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher blamed state legislators for blocking Sammy's Law, which would let New York City lower speed limits. The rally featured a ghost bike and calls for urgent safety improvements.

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry. The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
