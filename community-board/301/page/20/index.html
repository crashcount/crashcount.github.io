The driver turned, the cyclist went down. There was no protection—just paint on the road. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. The cyclist was left broken too. <em>“The road diet works where it’s been installed and it’s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,”</em> said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>8 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in Brooklyn CB1.

A 42-year-old man, crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A 49-year-old, killed by a bike on India Street. A 72-year-old, struck crossing Scholes and Union. Each one gone. Each one preventable.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept moving. Bikes and mopeds took lives too. No one is spared. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=promises-and-power>Promises and Power</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher stood up for the McGuinness redesign. She called out the opposition: <em>“I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.”</em> She urged the mayor to <em>“stay the course”</em> on safety <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>in a public statement</a>.</p><p>But the mayor did not. The city left two lanes for cars and painted lines for bikes. The road stayed wide. The danger stayed real.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

As of October 30, 2024, only one zone is active. No timeline exists for citywide rollout. The Department of Sanitation claims caution is needed to avoid price hikes and ensure effective change, but offers no clear metrics or deadlines. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, pleads, 'We can't wait another day to enforce truck safety requirements.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso warns, 'The city's goal right now should be to prevent bad implementation from undermining a good bill.' Delays keep streets deadly for workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The law’s promise remains unfulfilled.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) will reduce the street from four lanes to two. The DOT cited community and elected officials' feedback as the reason for the change. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said, "I'm just really grateful to the better angels of the Adams administration for coming back with this." The advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe called it a win for safety and vowed to keep pushing for improvements. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi praised the city's willingness to listen. Local business Broadway Stages, which had opposed the plan, said it respects the process. Removing car lanes will slow traffic and protect all users, according to advocates.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
