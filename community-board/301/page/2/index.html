Forty-five are seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, six families lost someone forever. Eight hundred forty-four people were hurt. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>A man steps out of his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the street. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said a witness</a>. No arrest. No comfort. The intersection is known for this. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>the same witness said</a>.</p><p>A dump truck turns in Williamsburg. A man kneels to pick up food. The truck hits him and keeps going. He does not get up. The driver leaves the scene. No arrests. The city moves on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Gothamist reported it</a>. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cars maim. E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Metal torn, traffic roaring, danger unchecked at the Brooklyn corner.</p><p class=mb3>At the intersection of Broadway and Lorimer Street in Brooklyn, a violent collision left a 26-year-old unlicensed moped rider ejected and bleeding from severe facial lacerations. According to the police report, 'Both drivers ran the light.' The moped's rear was torn in the crash, and the rider was thrown from his seat, remaining conscious but badly injured. The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor for both vehicles involved. The moped operator was unlicensed, but the data centers driver actions: both failed to obey traffic signals, creating lethal conditions for all road users. The police report describes the aftermath in stark terms: 'Blood ran from deep cuts across his face.' No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the systemic danger when drivers ignore traffic controls at busy Brooklyn intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
