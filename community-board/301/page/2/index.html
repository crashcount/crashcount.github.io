Fifty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five more lives lost, fifteen more bodies broken. The wounds do not heal. The pain does not fade. Each number is a name, a family, a future cut short.</p><p>A boy crushed by a dump truck turning left. A cyclist killed, helmet on, by a driver who did not stop. A pedestrian struck by a bike, left bleeding in the street. The stories repeat. The blood dries, but the tire marks remain.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The horror is not abstract. It is a mother who will never see her son again. It is a sister who will not get another call. <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>. Days after Madisyn Ruiz was killed by a driver doing donuts in a parking lot, the circular tire tracks were still there. The city washes away the blood, but not the grief.</p><p>On another block, two men crossing the street are struck and left to die. <strong>&ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>neighbors told reporters</a>. The driver fled. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has pushed for safer streets, sponsoring bills to curb repeat speeding and voting to extend school speed zones. State Senator Julia Salazar has co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would require speed limiters for drivers with a record of violations. These are steps forward, but the pace is slow. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers dragged their feet. No new laws for safer streets. Pedestrians and cyclists left exposed. The car stays king. The status quo kills. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The action, coordinated with Council Member Lincoln Restler, followed community complaints. Officers issued 40 summonses and towed 10 vehicles. The NYPD stated, "Following community complaints about illegal parking... the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated... to address the parking condition and clear the area." Council Members Restler and Crystal Hudson represent the district but did not claim credit. The crackdown targets city employees who abused parking privileges for years. Safety analysts note: "Cracking down on placard abuse reduces illegal parking, especially in bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, improving safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists by reclaiming public space and reducing driver entitlement."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No warning. No legal notice. Cyclists and advocates sued. They say the city broke its own law. The lane made streets safer. Now, the fight is in court. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 17, 2025, that activists and residents sued the city to stop the removal of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. Plaintiffs argue the city violated Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires advance notice and community input before removing bike lanes. The Department of Transportation skipped this step, announcing the removal on social media after consulting only select community members. The article quotes the lawsuit: the city acted "improperly, irrationally, without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion." Data cited in the suit show the upgraded lane improved safety for all road users. Councilman Lincoln Restler supported the legal action, seeking a restraining order to keep the lane. The case highlights failures in city process and the risks posed when safe infrastructure is abruptly erased.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
