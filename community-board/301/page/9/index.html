Fifty-three seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the count in Brooklyn Community Board 1 since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are people. A man crossing Withers Street crushed by a dump truck. A 49-year-old struck by a bike on India Street, left bleeding in the road. A 72-year-old killed at Scholes and Union. The list goes on. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just last week, a box truck driver killed a pedestrian on Morgan Avenue. There was no marked crosswalk. It was the third death on that stretch in three years. <strong>“I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Juan Ignacio Serra</a>. The city has not acted.</p><h2 id=streets-built-for-trucks-not-people>Streets Built for Trucks, Not People</h2><p>Morgan Avenue is the only north-south route in North Brooklyn. Trucks rule the road. Cyclists and pedestrians dodge for their lives. <strong>“A lot of people work and go by bike because it&rsquo;s the most efficient way of moving and unfortunately they have to deal with these dangerous conditions,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Serra said</a>. The city has held meetings. Leaders have written letters. Still, the street stays the same. The danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local officials—Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher—have backed calls for protected bike lanes and safer crossings on Morgan Avenue. They have voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. But the city has not broken ground. Advocacy alone does not pour concrete or paint lines.</p><p><strong>The deaths keep coming. The silence from City Hall is louder than the trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a protected bike lane on Morgan Avenue. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>Don’t wait for another family to grieve. The street will not fix itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, reported by Streetsblog NYC, was not a bill or vote but a personal shift. Sohn said, 'It disconnects you from the life of the city.' She praised Albany’s walkability and called car ownership a hassle. Governor Hochul also spoke on the need for walkable cities and announced a $400-million downtown plan. No committee, bill number, or formal legislative action is tied to this event. According to safety analysts, this is an individual choice and a vague policy gesture; without concrete legislative changes, there is no measurable system-wide safety impact for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bill forces reckless drivers to install speed limiters. Lawmakers act after years of carnage. Streets remain perilous for walkers and riders until the law takes hold.</p><p class=mb3>On May 21, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee advanced bill S4045B, known as the Stop Super Speeders bill. The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Democrats may let it advance with a hollow 'Aye Without Recommendation.' Meanwhile, the Idaho Stop bill, which could save cyclists’ lives, remains stalled. NYPD cracks down on riders. Cyclists keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee considered S533, a bill to repeal congestion pricing, after a procedural motion by Sen. Jack Martins. Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The old highway’s days are numbered. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a city-funded public engagement process for a major safety redesign of Conduit Boulevard, a three-mile corridor linking Atlantic Avenue to the Belt Parkway and JFK Airport. The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
