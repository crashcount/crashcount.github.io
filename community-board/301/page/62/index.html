I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>the same witness said</a>.</p><p>A three-year-old girl steps from a double-parked car onto Bedford Avenue. An e-bike slams into her. She is knocked down. She goes to the hospital. The cyclist stays at the scene. No arrest. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>The New York Post showed the video</a>.</p><p>A dump truck turns in Williamsburg. A man kneels to pick up food. The truck hits him and keeps going. He does not get up. The driver leaves the scene. No arrests. The city moves on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Gothamist reported it</a>. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cars maim. E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Crashes follow. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls out illegal placard parking. He backs new laws and outside enforcement. Streets stay dangerous while police ignore the rules. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 22, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler issued a statement targeting police placard abuse in Brooklyn. The matter, highlighted in the annual March (Parking) Madness contest, compared the 84th and 69th Precincts for their illegal parking practices. Restler said, "Placard permit holders and users of fake placards park illegally every day and it's simply the status quo." He noted, "These cars obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and undermine safety on our streets." Restler supports legislation to reduce placard issuance and the creation of an independent enforcement unit outside the NYPD. Between January 2017 and February 2022, the 84th Precinct area saw 219 crashes injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. Police cars often took over sidewalks despite having two parking lots. The statement underscores how unchecked police parking endangers vulnerable road users and blocks safe passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to ban moving billboards, echoing the matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to banning moving billboards.' Council Members Gale A. Brewer (primary), Justin L. Brannan, Erik D. Bottcher, Kalman Yeger, and Lincoln Restler sponsored the measure. The bill sought to codify an existing city rule (34 RCNY 4-12(j)), making it illegal to operate, stand, or park vehicles for commercial advertising. Violators would face a $500 penalty. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

Plastic bollards fail. Drivers block lanes. Restler and activists push for concrete barriers. Seventy injuries since 2019. DOT delays. Riders wait. Danger remains. Lives at risk until real protection arrives.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2022, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined activists to demand the Department of Transportation install concrete barriers on the Grand Street bike lane. The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.' The call is clear: real barriers, not broken promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
