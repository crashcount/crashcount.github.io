A man kneels to pick up food. The truck hits him and keeps going. He does not get up. The driver leaves the scene. No arrests. The city moves on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Gothamist reported it</a>. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cars maim. E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable commuters pay the price in time and risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) responded to the ongoing G train shutdown, which began June 28 for signal upgrades. The shutdown forced 160,000 daily riders onto shuttle buses, LIRR, and Citi Bike. The matter, titled 'NYC’s G train shutdown causes longer, pricier commutes for some straphangers,' highlights Restler’s push for a dedicated busway, more ferry service, and expanded Citi Bike access—none of which materialized. Restler said, 'I think we're trying to make the best out of a challenging situation,' but admitted his calls for safer, more reliable alternatives were ignored. Citi Bike fares rose 20%. Riders struggle to find bikes or docks. Public defender Shane Ferro called it a missed chance for protected bike lanes and bus corridors. The city failed to protect vulnerable road users, leaving them exposed to longer, riskier commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This temporary closure, set through mid-August, aims to ease congestion for shuttle buses during the G train shutdown. The Department of Transportation banned left turns and blocked cars, opening the street to people. Council member Lincoln Restler said, 'Having an alternative use for this space during this period for the G train [shutdown] makes a ton of sense. It gives us an opportunity to see how it goes.' DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the closure will 'enhance safety and create new public space.' The North Brooklyn Parks Alliance set up planters to keep cars out. A 2020 crash pushed locals to demand change. Over 2,000 signed a petition for a permanent plaza.

The matter, titled 'Cyclists call on DOT to fix ‘chaotic’ Kent Avenue bike lane in Brooklyn,' highlights chaos along the north Brooklyn waterfront. Restler is organizing local businesses to pressure DOT, demanding wider bike lanes and sidewalks, curb separation to block drivers, and safer pedestrian crossings. He says, 'If we really care about cyclists and their safety in New York City, then we should design and implement bike lanes that show it.' DOT spokesperson Will Livingston says the agency is reviewing the proposal but notes the city’s priority is elsewhere. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger: narrow lanes, illegal parking, and forced detours into traffic. No formal bill number or committee stage yet. Restler’s push centers vulnerable road users, demanding the city act before more are hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, a vocal supporter of the lane-reduction plan, defeated challenger Anathea Simpkins, who was backed by anti-redesign group Keep McGuinness Moving. Gallagher secured over 75 percent of the vote, declaring, “North Brooklyn demands Mayor Adams finish the job and make McGuinness safe.” Down-ballot, street safety advocates Luke Ohlson and Jenna Bimbi also won, both endorsed by Make McGuinness Safe. Opponents, including Broadway Stages executives, lost every race. Despite a partial redesign last year, the city has stalled on completing safety improvements.
