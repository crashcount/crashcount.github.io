E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On February 22, 2022, police arrested Tariq Witherspoon, charging him with criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving, and leaving the scene. The matter sparked renewed urgency for street safety. As the article states, 'Parents and teachers at the school had a huge rally... to demand that the city finally redesign McGuinness Boulevard for safety—a request that dates back more than a decade.' Council Member Steve Levin and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher have both called for action. Gallagher said, 'We must reform the way we use the roads and how we design them so that when drivers make mistakes... they don't kill people.' Despite a $40-million redesign promise from then-Mayor de Blasio, the project remains in planning. The community continues to demand real change to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, representing District 50, responded to the arrest, stating, 'Victims of vehicular homicide rarely see an arrest made in their case.' Gallagher credited the Highway District Collision Investigation Squad and the 94th Precinct for their persistence. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called the street 'a highway cutting our community in two,' blaming systemic failure for repeated deaths. After Jensen's killing, then-mayor Bill de Blasio pledged $39 million for a full redesign of the boulevard. Interim safety measures, like shorter light cycles and a new crosswalk, have been installed, but the city has not released final plans.

He tried to ride the Schermerhorn Street bike lane after a snowstorm. The lane was blocked by snow and illegally parked vehicles. Restler took 41 minutes to travel half a mile and was forced to leave the lane. He declared, 'No one should have to bike into traffic because of a row of illegally parked cars.' Restler called for a comprehensive street redesign and protected bike lanes, saying, 'There’s a crisis on Schermerhorn Street.' The Department of Transportation is reportedly working on a proposal. Restler’s action highlights the failure of painted lanes to protect cyclists. Most lanes in Downtown Brooklyn remain unprotected and easily blocked, putting riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
