Forty-five are seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, six families lost someone forever. Eight hundred fifty-two people were hurt. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>A man steps out of his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the street. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said a witness</a>. No arrest. No comfort. The intersection is known for this. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>the same witness said</a>.</p><p>A three-year-old girl steps from a double-parked car onto Bedford Avenue. An e-bike slams into her. She is knocked down. She goes to the hospital. The cyclist stays at the scene. No arrest. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>The New York Post showed the video</a>.</p><p>A dump truck turns in Williamsburg.

The city moves on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Gothamist reported it</a>. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cars maim. E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The police explicitly cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both parties. The sedan made contact with its right front bumper.

Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Gale A. Brewer, Justin L. Brannan, and Lincoln Restler. Assaults on bus workers reached 76 in 2022 and 70 in 2023. The Council argues that sharing live GPS data will let police and fire locate buses fast during emergencies.

Reynoso wants the city to set strict maximums on parking spaces in new developments, especially near transit. The matter summary states, 'Our recommendation is to remove as much parking as possible, but [if a] developer feels an obligation to put in a certain amount of parking, there should be a maximum allowable in transit-rich areas.' Reynoso supports eliminating parking mandates but says it is not enough. He points to developers building excess parking even near subways and calls for rules like Manhattan Core’s. Reynoso’s push aims to curb car dependency and promote safer, transit-oriented neighborhoods.

Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, a vocal supporter of the lane-reduction plan, defeated challenger Anathea Simpkins, who was backed by anti-redesign group Keep McGuinness Moving. Gallagher secured over 75 percent of the vote, declaring, “North Brooklyn demands Mayor Adams finish the job and make McGuinness safe.” Down-ballot, street safety advocates Luke Ohlson and Jenna Bimbi also won, both endorsed by Make McGuinness Safe. Opponents, including Broadway Stages executives, lost every race. Despite a partial redesign last year, the city has stalled on completing safety improvements. The election results send a clear mandate: voters want action to protect pedestrians and cyclists on McGuinness Boulevard.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The race centered on the future of McGuinness Boulevard, a street known for danger. Gallagher supported 'removing vehicle lanes and adding protected bike lanes to the historically dangerous McGuinness Boulevard.' Her challenger opposed these changes. Gallagher's victory signals strong support for street redesign. Greenpointers celebrated, seeing her win as a mandate for safety. The measure was not a formal council bill, but Gallagher’s stance and win put political weight behind protected bike lanes and fewer car lanes. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the community’s reaction shows the stakes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
