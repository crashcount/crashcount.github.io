Forty-five are seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, six families lost someone forever. Eight hundred fifty-two people were hurt.

E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Deadly danger remains for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><p class=mb3>On August 20, 2024, the city announced it will move forward with a pared-down redesign of McGuinness Boulevard. The plan, discussed in the Transportation Committee, keeps two vehicle lanes during peak hours and adds protected bike lanes along each curb. The official matter: 'City will move forward with stripped-back redesign of McGuinness Boulevard.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, joined by eight other elected officials, condemned the move, stating, 'Mayor Adams is going forward with a plan that fails Greenpoint by preserving the most dangerous elements of this roadway.' Local safety advocates and Restler argue the redesign ignores years of calls to address deadly conditions. The city’s plan abandons a previous proposal to remove a traffic lane, leaving the street’s core dangers in place. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, children—remain exposed on a corridor with a long record of crashes and deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and walkers claimed space. Safety replaced speed.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2024, a one-day closure of Driggs Avenue—dubbed 'Driggs Passage'—cut car traffic through McCarren Park in Williamsburg. The event, not a formal bill but a policy experiment, was championed by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Greenpoint), who said, "Today is a one-day experiment to just experience what it would be like to not have cars flying through the middle of our community's primary green space." The closure united two halves of the park, creating 1.5 acres of new open space. Organizers and residents, including Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance, called for a permanent ban on cars. Since 2020, city data shows 42 crashes on this stretch, injuring six cyclists and one pedestrian. The move echoes past car bans in Central and Prospect Parks, but faces resistance from city officials. The day showed what’s possible when cars yield to people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler, representing Greenpoint, pushed for car-free shuttle routes and stronger enforcement against double parking. He criticized the Department of Transportation and MTA for disregarding these requests, leaving shuttle riders stuck in traffic and packed buses.

Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life.

The incident, caught on camera, showed a Dodge Durango honking, then plowing through metal fences as volunteers dove for safety. The matter centers on repeated illegal parking by NYPD and municipal workers, which blocks safety measures and shrinks space for pedestrians. Restler stated, "It has been really frustrating that our city agencies that should be partners in this effort have undermined it." Kelly Carroll, Executive Director of the Atlantic Avenue BID, added, "We can't even set up a table if the cars are parked there. It renders the open street moot." No arrests have been made, but police are pursuing felony charges. The event exposes systemic failures in enforcement and agency accountability, putting vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New crossings, curb islands, and lane markings arrive. But key fixes—like daylighting and hard barriers—are missing. Locals and advocates say the changes fall short. The avenue remains a threat to walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced new safety upgrades for Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The project, not a council bill but a DOT initiative, includes a mid-block crossing, concrete pedestrian islands, and traffic signal tweaks. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi called the changes a boost for safety and growth. Councilman Lincoln Restler and Community Board 2 pushed for more: daylighting, hard barriers, and a full redesign. DOT declined, citing current priorities. Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives called Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous streets in New York City' and demanded a bold overhaul. Kelly Carroll of the Atlantic Avenue BID said the fixes are 'smart and needed,' but not enough. Over the past decade, 4,414 crashes injured 1,172 people on this 1.3-mile stretch. Advocates warn: without bigger changes, danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
