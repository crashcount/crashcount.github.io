I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>the same witness said</a>.</p><p>A three-year-old girl steps from a double-parked car onto Bedford Avenue. An e-bike slams into her. She is knocked down. She goes to the hospital. The cyclist stays at the scene. No arrest. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>The New York Post showed the video</a>.</p><p>A dump truck turns in Williamsburg. A man kneels to pick up food. The truck hits him and keeps going. He does not get up. The driver leaves the scene. No arrests. The city moves on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Gothamist reported it</a>. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cars maim. E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders keep risking their lives.</p><p class=mb3>On March 22, 2023, activists and City Council Members Chi Ossé and Lincoln Restler called for a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue between Flushing and Flatbush avenues in Brooklyn. The matter, described as 'the heavily used existing painted bike lane on Bedford Avenue puts people on bikes at risk because it is chronically blocked by double-parked vehicles,' highlights a deadly stretch for cyclists and pedestrians. Good Co., a Black-led bike club, and Transportation Alternatives lead the push. DOT acknowledged support and is open to future talks. The effort faces resistance from some community boards. Council Members Ossé and Restler publicly backed the project, pressing for urgent action. The current lane leaves cyclists exposed, forcing them into traffic and danger. Advocates demand real protection, not paint.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 17, 2023, Council Member Rita Joseph (D-Flatbush) introduced a bill to require New York City to build 100 miles of protected bike lanes annually, doubling the current Streets Plan mandate. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
