The driver turned, the cyclist went down. There was no protection—just paint on the road. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. The cyclist was left broken too. <em>“The road diet works where it’s been installed and it’s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,”</em> said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>8 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in Brooklyn CB1.

A 42-year-old man, crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A 49-year-old, killed by a bike on India Street. A 72-year-old, struck crossing Scholes and Union. Each one gone. Each one preventable.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept moving. Bikes and mopeds took lives too. No one is spared. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=promises-and-power>Promises and Power</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher stood up for the McGuinness redesign. She called out the opposition: <em>“I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.”</em> She urged the mayor to <em>“stay the course”</em> on safety <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>in a public statement</a>.</p><p>But the mayor did not. The city left two lanes for cars and painted lines for bikes. The road stayed wide. The danger stayed real.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a risk. Every promise broken is another family left to grieve.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installation of pedestrian lighting fixtures.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Krishnan, Bottcher, and others. The committee has not yet voted.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) announced on January 31, 2024, that only one of twenty zones—Jackson Heights, Corona, Elmhurst—will launch this year. The law aims to cut truck miles in half, add backup cameras, GPS, and safety training. DSNY spokesperson Joshua Goodman said contracts target safety and worker protections. Reynoso urged ongoing oversight, saying, 'It is important that DSNY continuously reassess implementation and course correct as needed.' Yet, delays persist, especially on installing guard rails to prevent pedestrians and cyclists from being swept under trucks. Justin Wood of NYLPI voiced concern over the slow rollout. The program promises fewer trucks and safer streets, but for now, most neighborhoods wait.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction.
