The driver turned, the cyclist went down. There was no protection—just paint on the road. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. The cyclist was left broken too. <em>“The road diet works where it’s been installed and it’s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,”</em> said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>8 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in Brooklyn CB1. Over a thousand were hurt. The numbers do not rest. They do not heal. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-loss>The Pattern of Loss</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 42-year-old man, crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A 49-year-old, killed by a bike on India Street. A 72-year-old, struck crossing Scholes and Union. Each one gone. Each one preventable.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept moving. Bikes and mopeds took lives too. No one is spared. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=promises-and-power>Promises and Power</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher stood up for the McGuinness redesign. She called out the opposition: <em>“I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.”</em> She urged the mayor to <em>“stay the course”</em> on safety <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>in a public statement</a>.</p><p>But the mayor did not. The city left two lanes for cars and painted lines for bikes. The road stayed wide. The danger stayed real.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a risk. Every promise broken is another family left to grieve.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the full McGuinness redesign. Demand protected lanes. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A child was hit weeks before. Injuries on e-bikes outnumber pedal bikes. Officials call it an emergency. The rule moves fast. Riders and workers face new limits.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 5, 2025, that Mayor Adams ordered Citi Bike to limit e-bike speeds to 15 mph, citing an 'emergency threat to life and property.' The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule. The move highlights rising e-bike use and the city’s struggle to manage micromobility safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
