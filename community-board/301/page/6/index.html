Fifty-three seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the count in Brooklyn Community Board 1 since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are people. A man crossing Withers Street crushed by a dump truck. A 49-year-old struck by a bike on India Street, left bleeding in the road. A 72-year-old killed at Scholes and Union. The list goes on. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just last week, a box truck driver killed a pedestrian on Morgan Avenue. There was no marked crosswalk. It was the third death on that stretch in three years. <strong>“I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Juan Ignacio Serra</a>. The city has not acted.</p><h2 id=streets-built-for-trucks-not-people>Streets Built for Trucks, Not People</h2><p>Morgan Avenue is the only north-south route in North Brooklyn. Trucks rule the road. Cyclists and pedestrians dodge for their lives. <strong>“A lot of people work and go by bike because it&rsquo;s the most efficient way of moving and unfortunately they have to deal with these dangerous conditions,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Serra said</a>. The city has held meetings. Leaders have written letters. Still, the street stays the same. The danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local officials—Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher—have backed calls for protected bike lanes and safer crossings on Morgan Avenue. They have voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. But the city has not broken ground. Advocacy alone does not pour concrete or paint lines.</p><p><strong>The deaths keep coming. The silence from City Hall is louder than the trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a protected bike lane on Morgan Avenue. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>Don’t wait for another family to grieve. The street will not fix itself.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child.
