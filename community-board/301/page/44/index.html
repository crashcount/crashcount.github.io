He does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, six people died in crashes on Brooklyn CB1’s streets. Twenty-two more were seriously injured. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—all caught in the same crosswalks, on the same corners. In total, 906 people were hurt in 1,879 crashes this past year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A cyclist is killed, his head split open. A witness says, &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>NY Daily News</a>). The driver leaves. The street is quiet again. The blood dries. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm: 385 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses: 56. Motorcycles and mopeds: 25. Bikes: 24. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in the road, families waiting at hospitals, shoes left behind on the curb (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders have signed on to bills. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher have backed laws to curb repeat speeders and expand protected bike lanes. But the bills sit in committee. The danger does not wait. &ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; said a neighbor after another crash (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Some progress: daylighting bills to clear sightlines at crosswalks, and support for speed-limiting tech for the worst drivers. But every delay means another family gets the call. Every loophole is a life lost.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now? No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city, by lawmakers, by those who look away. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on bills that stop repeat speeders.</p><p>The dead cannot speak. The living must. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people.

The need is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A 1280, now in the sponsorship stage, sits before the New York State Assembly. Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous. Lawmakers are under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver turned right from 24th Avenue onto 29th Street, hitting Kao and killing her instantly. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called the crash 'absolutely heartbreaking,' noting Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in Astoria in 2.5 years. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez blamed 'poorly designed streets,' saying, 'traffic violence is the outcome of poorly designed streets and is a solvable problem.' The area has almost no protected bike lanes. In 2022, Community Board 1 saw 1,979 crashes, injuring 120 cyclists and 163 pedestrians. Politicians and residents demand safer streets, better enforcement, and an end to car dominance. The deadly toll continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
