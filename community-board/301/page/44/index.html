Forty-five are seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, six families lost someone forever. Eight hundred fifty-two people were hurt. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>A man steps out of his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign.

E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 29, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler and other city officials rallied for Sammy’s Law, a bill allowing New York City to set its own speed limits without state approval. The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver in 2013, would let the city lower limits to 20 mph. The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets. Advocates cite a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit change. Families demand action to prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Good Co., a Black-led bike club, and Transportation Alternatives lead the push. DOT acknowledged support and is open to future talks. The effort faces resistance from some community boards.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler led the amendment, removing a financial incentive and adding a digital training requirement. Reports can only target unoccupied cars. Doug Gordon called the new version 'silly,' saying it adds hoops and limits scope. Eric McClure said the bill still improves things, but activists argue these changes gut its power.

Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the city for favoring a three-lane solution and sidelining affected communities.

No cash reward for reporting. Only trained New Yorkers can file. First, Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. Citywide in three years. Aim: stop blocked bike and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers leads. Restler pushes safety. Streets stay in focus.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 501, a bill to let citizens report drivers blocking bike or bus lanes, advanced in the City Council on March 3, 2023. The Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), steered the revision. The bill, sponsored by Lincoln Restler, drops the 25 percent ticket bounty but expands reporting zones and phases in citywide coverage over three years. The matter summary states: 'A long-stalled bill that would allow people to report drivers who block bike or bus lanes is about to move forward in the City Council, but without its central feature: people who make complaints will no longer receive 25 percent of the resulting ticket revenue.' Restler said, 'My top priority is expanding street safety.' The bill now requires a digital training course and valid ID for complainants. Only unoccupied cars can be reported. The Department of Transportation must create a mobile app and post signage. Advocates support the bill, citing the need for civilian enforcement to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
