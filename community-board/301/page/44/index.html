Forty-five are seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, six families lost someone forever. Eight hundred fifty-two people were hurt. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>A man steps out of his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the street. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said a witness</a>. No arrest. No comfort. The intersection is known for this. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot.

No arrest. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>The New York Post showed the video</a>.</p><p>A dump truck turns in Williamsburg.

The city moves on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Gothamist reported it</a>. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cars maim. E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter, titled 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass...S.315/A.1416, which would authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program,' was sponsored by Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Amanda Farías, Julie Won, Carlina Rivera, and Crystal Hudson. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The measure aimed to protect pedestrians and cyclists by slowing traffic where people gather. But with the bill stalled, Open Streets remain at risk from fast-moving vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Locals and advocates slam the move. They wanted fewer cars, less pollution, and safer streets. Officials focus on beautification. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2022, the city unveiled plans to redesign the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE), proposing to restore three lanes of traffic in each direction. The Department of Transportation cited federal and state rules for the widening. The plan, discussed in a public meeting, drew sharp criticism. The matter summary reads: 'proposing three similar options for a redesign that will restore three lanes of traffic in each direction, with a park on top.' Liz Denys of Bridges 4 People called out the city for ignoring creative ideas and failing to reduce car and truck traffic. William Meehan criticized the focus on beautification over safety. Council Member Lincoln Restler urged a reduction in car impacts, while Borough President Antonio Reynoso condemned the neglect of environmental justice. Advocates say the plan keeps vulnerable road users in danger and misses a chance to make streets safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Reynoso insists the new corridor must be at least as long as Manhattan’s six-and-a-half-mile stretch, not just a patchwork of short Open Streets. He told Streetsblog, "We have to think about, long-term, having a route that is as long if not longer than the one Manhattan does." Reynoso commits city funding to make this happen. The Adams administration has yet to announce plans. The matter, described as 'expansion of car-free Summer Streets program to Brooklyn,' remains in policy advocacy, with support from public-space advocates. Reynoso’s push centers on opening streets to pedestrians and cyclists, not just for events, but as a lasting, borough-wide change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
