Fifty-three seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the count in Brooklyn Community Board 1 since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are people. A man crossing Withers Street crushed by a dump truck. A 49-year-old struck by a bike on India Street, left bleeding in the road. A 72-year-old killed at Scholes and Union. The list goes on. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just last week, a box truck driver killed a pedestrian on Morgan Avenue. There was no marked crosswalk. It was the third death on that stretch in three years. <strong>“I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Juan Ignacio Serra</a>. The city has not acted.</p><h2 id=streets-built-for-trucks-not-people>Streets Built for Trucks, Not People</h2><p>Morgan Avenue is the only north-south route in North Brooklyn. Trucks rule the road. Cyclists and pedestrians dodge for their lives. <strong>“A lot of people work and go by bike because it&rsquo;s the most efficient way of moving and unfortunately they have to deal with these dangerous conditions,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Serra said</a>. The city has held meetings. Leaders have written letters. Still, the street stays the same. The danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local officials—Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher—have backed calls for protected bike lanes and safer crossings on Morgan Avenue. They have voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. But the city has not broken ground. Advocacy alone does not pour concrete or paint lines.</p><p><strong>The deaths keep coming. The silence from City Hall is louder than the trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a protected bike lane on Morgan Avenue. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>Don’t wait for another family to grieve. The street will not fix itself.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The old highway’s days are numbered. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a city-funded public engagement process for a major safety redesign of Conduit Boulevard, a three-mile corridor linking Atlantic Avenue to the Belt Parkway and JFK Airport. The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police set a roadblock. The driver swerved, nearly hitting a lieutenant. A shot rang out. The car crashed. One man died. The state investigates. The road stayed dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on May 2, 2025, that a man was killed after a police-involved shooting during a stolen car stop in Brooklyn. Officers, following new NYPD pursuit rules, did not chase but instead set a roadblock. According to NYPD Chief John Chell, 'We didn't pursue the vehicle, we strategically radioed ahead to shut down traffic.' The driver, Jumaane Wright, swerved toward officers, nearly striking a lieutenant, who fired a single shot. Wright crashed a mile later and died at the hospital. The Attorney General's investigation is standard for such incidents. The case highlights risks in high-speed police interventions and the ongoing challenge of balancing pursuit policies with public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
