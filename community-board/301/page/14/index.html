Forty-five are seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, six families lost someone forever. Eight hundred fifty-two people were hurt. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>A man steps out of his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the street. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said a witness</a>. No arrest. No comfort. The intersection is known for this. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot.

No arrest. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>The New York Post showed the video</a>.</p><p>A dump truck turns in Williamsburg.

The city moves on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Gothamist reported it</a>. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cars maim. E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Anger filled the streets.</p><p class=mb3>On September 8, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and elected officials, including Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, gathered in Manhattan to protest Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing. The event, described as a 'citywide subway accessibility day of action,' spotlighted the $15 billion shortfall now facing the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan. According to the event summary, 'the cancellation of elevator installations at 23 subway stations' followed the funding cut. Gallagher condemned the decision, declaring, 'We all matter, and we all need elevators, and we all need congestion pricing.' Comptroller Brad Lander called the move 'shameful.' The rally demanded immediate reinstatement of congestion pricing to restore funding for subway accessibility, directly impacting disabled New Yorkers, parents, and seniors. The protest underscored the systemic danger of underfunded transit and the toll on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $368 million project, led by the MTA, replaced century-old signals with Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC), aiming for faster, more reliable service. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) praised the MTA’s handling and shuttle bus communication but criticized the city for not creating dedicated bus lanes during the closure, saying, 'They expressed dismay, however, that the city had not constructed a dedicated lane so shuttle buses could move faster.' Restler called for renewed investment in the MTA, including the resumption of congestion pricing, to fund future upgrades. The project continues through 2027, but no more full shutdowns are planned.
