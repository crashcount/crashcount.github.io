Fifty-one seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the cost of traffic violence in Brooklyn CB1 since 2022. The names fade, but the numbers stay. In the last twelve months alone, five people died. Five more families left with a hole that never heals.</p><p>Last spring, a cyclist was killed on Lynch Street. In March, a truck crushed a child crossing Withers and Woodpoint. In June, a sedan struck a cyclist on Kent Avenue. The street does not care who you are. It takes the young, the old, the careful, the hurried.</p><h2 id=the-usual-weapons-cars-trucks-bikes>The Usual Weapons: Cars, Trucks, Bikes</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm:</strong> 1 killed, 384 injured. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 3, injured 53.</strong> <strong>Bikes killed 2, injured 22.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds hurt 25. The numbers are plain. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=the-policy-front-promises-and-delays>The Policy Front: Promises and Delays</h2><p>Local leaders have spoken. Some have acted. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot and bike. The bill <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sits in committee, waiting for a vote</a>.</p><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher backed the McGuinness Boulevard redesign. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>called out the opposition</a> for what it is: “I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.”</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Neighbors know why. “Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,” a resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>told reporters after the last hit-and-run</a>.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, the people in charge. Call your council member. Demand a vote on daylighting. Tell the mayor to finish the job on McGuinness. Join the fight. If you wait, the street will not.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident highlights ongoing failures in city safety policy. The intersection is described as 'very dangerous,' with fast turns and drivers not yielding. Only 27 percent of the city’s 5,860 heavy garbage trucks have side guards, despite a 2019 city deal requiring them by 2024. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, then a Council Member, said, 'side rails should be installed sooner.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives called for 'bold action' and criticized city officials for delaying redesigns and safety steps. The private carting industry remains under scrutiny after repeated fatal crashes. No council bill number is attached, but the event underscores the urgent need for systemic change to protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill requires the NYC Department of Transportation to give extra notifications and presentations to community boards and local officials before installing or removing bike lanes or racks. The matter summary reads: 'require the NYC DOT to provide additional notifications and presentations.' Advocacy groups, including Bike New York, are preparing testimony to stall the bill before it reaches the Senate floor or Assembly Cities Committee. Critics argue the DOT already must notify community boards under the 'Fidler rule,' and that this bill would gum up the process, delaying life-saving bike infrastructure. A legislative source called the bill 'boneheaded.' Public polls show strong support for more bike lanes, with only a small minority opposed.

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, titled 'Borough beeps join city transit advocates for better bus service,' spotlighted stalled promises and called for Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul to deliver. Restler and others backed the Bus Turnaround Coalition’s push for network redesigns, expanded and more frequent service, all-door boarding, and tougher enforcement in bus lanes. Comptroller Brad Lander stressed that 'expanded bus routes must also match 21st century travel patterns.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso linked better buses to less car dependence and climate action. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged 150 new miles of busways and lanes. The campaign aims to speed up buses, cut car dominance, and put vulnerable road users first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gallagher argues, "$200 million is the amount of money it would take to make it safe and functional." The push follows the Empire State Trail program, which sent most of its funds to rural areas. Advocates like Terri Carta and Jon Orcutt stress the need for a comprehensive, citywide network and dedicated funding. The city DOT and Parks Department did not comment.

Gallagher credited the Highway District Collision Investigation Squad and the 94th Precinct for their persistence. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called the street 'a highway cutting our community in two,' blaming systemic failure for repeated deaths. After Jensen's killing, then-mayor Bill de Blasio pledged $39 million for a full redesign of the boulevard. Interim safety measures, like shorter light cycles and a new crosswalk, have been installed, but the city has not released final plans.

The matter sparked renewed urgency for street safety.

Council Member Steve Levin and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher have both called for action. Gallagher said, 'We must reform the way we use the roads and how we design them so that when drivers make mistakes... they don't kill people.' Despite a $40-million redesign promise from then-Mayor de Blasio, the project remains in planning.
