He does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, six people died in crashes on Brooklyn CB1’s streets. Twenty-two more were seriously injured. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—all caught in the same crosswalks, on the same corners. In total, 906 people were hurt in 1,879 crashes this past year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A cyclist is killed, his head split open. A witness says, &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>NY Daily News</a>). The driver leaves. The street is quiet again. The blood dries. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm: 385 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses: 56. Motorcycles and mopeds: 25. Bikes: 24. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in the road, families waiting at hospitals, shoes left behind on the curb (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Local leaders have signed on to bills. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher have backed laws to curb repeat speeders and expand protected bike lanes. But the bills sit in committee. The danger does not wait. &ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; said a neighbor after another crash (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Some progress: daylighting bills to clear sightlines at crosswalks, and support for speed-limiting tech for the worst drivers. But every delay means another family gets the call. Every loophole is a life lost.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now? No More Waiting</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city, by lawmakers, by those who look away. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on bills that stop repeat speeders.</p><p>The dead cannot speak. The living must. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Politics won.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2023, Mayor Adams reversed course and canceled the McGuinness Boulevard safety redesign. The plan, developed by the Department of Transportation after extensive community engagement, aimed to curb crashes and deaths on this notorious Brooklyn corridor. The matter, described as a choice between 'Keep McGuinness Moving' and 'Make McGuinness Safe,' drew strong support from Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Lincoln Restler, state Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez. Gallagher condemned the move, saying, 'The status quo is deadly and no campaign donation is enough to replace a life.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman called the decision 'very disappointing.' The mayor’s action, driven by political and donor pressure, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and sets a grim precedent for future safety projects.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to amend city code by setting penalties for alternate side parking violations at $65 for a first offense and $100 for each subsequent offense within a 12-month period. After three violations in a year, the vehicle would be towed if found in violation again. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing penalties for alternate side parking violations and requiring towing of certain vehicles in violation of alternate side parking rules.' Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor) led the effort. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

Nydia Velázquez, and Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez urged state officials to join the city in seeking federal funding for the BQGreen park proposal. The plan would cap a stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in south Williamsburg, creating 3.5 acres of new parkland. Reynoso called on Governor Kathy Hochul to act as a co-applicant for funds, stating, "We're calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to be a co-applicant alongside the City of New York for federal funding to finally deck the BQE." Velázquez said, "We are fighting to reimagine the way to reconnect neighborhoods, improve traffic and reduce toxic pollution." Gutierrez stressed the urgent need for open space and clean air. The proposal, estimated at $100-200 million, is framed as an environmental justice effort to heal a community long divided and harmed by the highway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets open, but only for a while.</p><p class=mb3>On June 12, 2023, Mayor Adams announced the expansion of New York City’s Summer Streets program to all five boroughs. The program, managed by the Department of Transportation, will run on five Saturdays in July and August, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., covering 17 miles. Borough presidents Antonio Reynoso (Brooklyn) and Donovan Richards (Queens) pushed for this expansion, with Reynoso praising the use of major corridors like Eastern Parkway. Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing. The expansion marks a step forward, but the early end time leaves advocates wanting more.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
