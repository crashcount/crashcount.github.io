Fifty-three seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the count in Brooklyn Community Board 1 since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are people. A man crossing Withers Street crushed by a dump truck. A 49-year-old struck by a bike on India Street, left bleeding in the road. A 72-year-old killed at Scholes and Union. The list goes on. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just last week, a box truck driver killed a pedestrian on Morgan Avenue. There was no marked crosswalk. It was the third death on that stretch in three years. <strong>“I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Juan Ignacio Serra</a>. The city has not acted.</p><h2 id=streets-built-for-trucks-not-people>Streets Built for Trucks, Not People</h2><p>Morgan Avenue is the only north-south route in North Brooklyn. Trucks rule the road. Cyclists and pedestrians dodge for their lives. <strong>“A lot of people work and go by bike because it&rsquo;s the most efficient way of moving and unfortunately they have to deal with these dangerous conditions,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Serra said</a>. The city has held meetings. Leaders have written letters. Still, the street stays the same. The danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local officials—Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher—have backed calls for protected bike lanes and safer crossings on Morgan Avenue. They have voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. But the city has not broken ground. Advocacy alone does not pour concrete or paint lines.</p><p><strong>The deaths keep coming. The silence from City Hall is louder than the trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a protected bike lane on Morgan Avenue. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>Don’t wait for another family to grieve. The street will not fix itself.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

More parking means more cars, more danger for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On February 18, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 15 rejected a rezoning proposal at 2510 Coney Island Ave. The board’s vote came after the developer slashed housing units and promised a one-to-one parking ratio. The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers. The City Council is expected to reject the project, blocking new homes and locking in car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) would not commit to a 'road diet' or redesign for the deadly 13-block Brooklyn stretch, pending a traffic study that could take two years and requires Council funding. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé, along with Borough President Antonio Reynoso, demanded a fully funded redesign, calling Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough.' Residents testified about fear and danger from speeding cars and blind turns. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured in 831 crashes. Advocates and lawmakers condemned DOT's reluctance, calling it emblematic of citywide failures. The rezoning plan, which could add thousands of residents, now moves to the full Council.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states the plan 'aims to bring nearly 4,600 new apartments, safeguard manufacturing space, and enhance pedestrian safety and infrastructure.' Hudson praised Borough President Reynoso’s recommendations, emphasizing 'strong manufacturing requirements, affordable housing, tenant protections, street safety, and workforce opportunities.' She called for a 'robust redesign of Atlantic Avenue that incorporates street safety improvements.' The plan includes a 'road diet' to reduce lanes, more metered parking, and safety upgrades at dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates raised concerns about displacement, legal protections, and infrastructure strain.
