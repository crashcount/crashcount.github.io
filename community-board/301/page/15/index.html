Assembly Member Emily Gallagher <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>supported the McGuinness Boulevard redesign</a>, calling out the cost of delay. She has sponsored bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat speeding</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>. State Senator Julia Salazar and others have voted yes to require speed limiters for repeat offenders. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so citywide. Each day of delay is another risk, another family changed forever.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the end of repeat offenders. Join the fight.

The article states, 'Three people were injured, including an MTA bus driver and a young girl, in a collision that pinned two cars between a box truck and a city bus.' Footage showed two vehicles sandwiched between the bus and truck, with one car stacked atop another. The injured included a 59-year-old MTA driver, a 33-year-old woman, and a 9-year-old girl. All were hospitalized in stable condition. The cause of the crash was not determined at the time of reporting. The incident highlights the risks at busy intersections and the dangers posed by large vehicles in dense urban traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say it slows life-saving street redesigns. Advocates warn it props up car culture and blocks safer bike lanes. The bill risks more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 103, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to notify Council members every time a single parking spot is repurposed—for car-share, bike corrals, or Citi Bike docks. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
