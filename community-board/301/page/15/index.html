The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs crush. Cars maim. E-bikes and mopeds, too, take their share.</strong> In three years: trucks and buses killed three, cars and SUVs killed one, bikes killed two. The rest are injuries—hundreds, each year, from every kind of machine. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, they can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lowered. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk—Albany must act, or they go dark. The city redesigns intersections, but the deaths keep coming. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, more lives are lost. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference.

Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) will install a bike lane on the southern stretch but keep two traffic lanes in each direction. The original plan called for a road diet and a parking-protected bike lane. After pushback from business interests, DOT scaled back. The new plan converts the outer lane to parking overnight, a design that has led to illegal parking and safety hazards for cyclists. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the plan, saying, 'this plan fails to dramatically slow down traffic on this dangerous boulevard.' The advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe accused the mayor of breaking his promise to prioritize safety. The compromise removes some parking, which local businesses oppose. Despite DOT claims, the redesign does not slow traffic or protect vulnerable road users as promised.

The plaza, once open all week, will now close to cars only on weekends. Locals and advocates wanted more. Businesses pushed back. Most neighbors don’t own cars. The fight for safe space continues.</p><p class=mb3>On August 13, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it would end 24/7 pedestrianization of Bedford Slip in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The decision, not a council bill but a DOT action, follows a six-week trial during the G train shutdown. DOT will allow car-free hours only on weekends from late September through year’s end. The matter summary: 'DOT Rejects 24-7 Open Street for ‘Bedford Slip,’ Preferring Weekend-Only Hours.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Rep. Nydia Velázquez supported a permanent plaza. Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance vowed to keep pushing for full-time closure. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the agency is working with residents on a long-term vision. Most local households rely on transit, biking, or walking. The decision leaves vulnerable road users with less protection during the week.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
