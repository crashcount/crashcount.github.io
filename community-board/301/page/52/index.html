The driver turned, the cyclist went down. There was no protection—just paint on the road. The city had promised a safer street. The promise was broken. The cyclist was left broken too. <em>“The road diet works where it’s been installed and it’s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,”</em> said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>8 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in Brooklyn CB1.

A 42-year-old man, crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A 49-year-old, killed by a bike on India Street. A 72-year-old, struck crossing Scholes and Union. Each one gone. Each one preventable.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept moving. Bikes and mopeds took lives too. No one is spared. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=promises-and-power>Promises and Power</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher stood up for the McGuinness redesign. She called out the opposition: <em>“I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.”</em> She urged the mayor to <em>“stay the course”</em> on safety <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>in a public statement</a>.</p><p>But the mayor did not. The city left two lanes for cars and painted lines for bikes. The road stayed wide. The danger stayed real.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Every delay is a risk. Every promise broken is another family left to grieve.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

Reynoso insists the new corridor must be at least as long as Manhattan’s six-and-a-half-mile stretch, not just a patchwork of short Open Streets. He told Streetsblog, "We have to think about, long-term, having a route that is as long if not longer than the one Manhattan does." Reynoso commits city funding to make this happen. The Adams administration has yet to announce plans. The matter, described as 'expansion of car-free Summer Streets program to Brooklyn,' remains in policy advocacy, with support from public-space advocates. Reynoso’s push centers on opening streets to pedestrians and cyclists, not just for events, but as a lasting, borough-wide change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit.
