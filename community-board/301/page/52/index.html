Forty-seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In three and a half years, the count keeps rising. Cyclists, children, elders. No one is spared.</p><p>A man on a bike, helmet strapped, is thrown and killed on Lynch Street. A child is crushed by a dump truck turning left on Withers. A pedestrian is struck dead by a speeding e-bike on India Street. The numbers are cold, but the stories burn.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks are the main killers.</strong> They took four lives. Trucks alone killed three. Bikes and e-bikes killed two. Mopeds and motorcycles, another two. The rest are left broken—bones, heads, lives. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>: cars and trucks caused the most harm, but every mode can kill when the street is built for speed and chaos.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have put their names on bills. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez and Lincoln Restler co-sponsored laws to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for citywide daylighting at intersections. But the bills sit in committee, waiting. The city promises, but the street stays the same.</p><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called out the city’s failure to act: “I truly believe that the opposition to a road diet on McGuinness is about fear, bad faith and control.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>She urged the mayor to stay the course</a>. Still, the dead keep coming.</p><p>A neighbor saw the aftermath: “He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>The driver had a mask. He hit the guy and he left.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The street can be changed. The bills can move. The crosswalks can be cleared. The speed can be slowed. But only if you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylight at every corner, protected lanes, and a street that does not kill.</strong> The silence of leaders is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates and officials push Albany to let the city run cameras all day, every day. The state stalls. Lives hang in the balance. The data is clear. Action lags.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill 5602, still pending in Albany, would let New York City control and expand speed camera enforcement to 24/7. The Transportation Alternatives report, 'Speeding Doesn’t Sleep,' warns that 59 percent of city road deaths occur when cameras are off. The report urges full-time operation, noting cameras cut speeding by 72 percent where installed. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls passage 'very important.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Governor Hochul support local control. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives says, 'We need Albany to allow New York City to operate speed safety cameras 24/7 so every neighborhood is protected from speeding drivers every hour of the day, every day of the week.' Despite strong public support, the legislature has not acted. The evidence is stark: when cameras are off, people die.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users.
