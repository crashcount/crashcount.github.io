Fifty-three seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the count in Brooklyn Community Board 1 since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are people. A man crossing Withers Street crushed by a dump truck. A 49-year-old struck by a bike on India Street, left bleeding in the road. A 72-year-old killed at Scholes and Union. The list goes on. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Just last week, a box truck driver killed a pedestrian on Morgan Avenue. There was no marked crosswalk. It was the third death on that stretch in three years. <strong>“I was sad and angry at the same time because I still feel that these are things that can be prevented. I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Juan Ignacio Serra</a>. The city has not acted.</p><h2 id=streets-built-for-trucks-not-people>Streets Built for Trucks, Not People</h2><p>Morgan Avenue is the only north-south route in North Brooklyn. Trucks rule the road. Cyclists and pedestrians dodge for their lives. <strong>“A lot of people work and go by bike because it&rsquo;s the most efficient way of moving and unfortunately they have to deal with these dangerous conditions,”</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Serra said</a>. The city has held meetings. Leaders have written letters. Still, the street stays the same. The danger stays.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local officials—Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher—have backed calls for protected bike lanes and safer crossings on Morgan Avenue. They have voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. But the city has not broken ground. Advocacy alone does not pour concrete or paint lines.</p><p><strong>The deaths keep coming. The silence from City Hall is louder than the trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a protected bike lane on Morgan Avenue. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>Don’t wait for another family to grieve. The street will not fix itself.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers. The group demanded action to protect and improve transit for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists face danger. The city law demands protection. DOT chose traffic flow over safety. Advocates and officials condemned the move. Illegally parked cars block the shared lane. Cyclists remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On October 20, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it would not install a temporary protected bike lane on Brooklyn’s Fourth Avenue during major construction, despite Local Law 124 requiring such measures when bike lanes are blocked. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who once supported the law as a council member, now claims a protected lane would worsen traffic and turning conflicts. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Alexa Aviles criticized the decision, with Reynoso stating, 'protected bike lanes are essential,' and Aviles urging the city to 'install an alternative, fully protected bike lane where the road can accommodate one.' Advocates argue the shared lane is unsafe and often blocked by cars. The DOT’s move prioritizes vehicle flow over cyclist safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
