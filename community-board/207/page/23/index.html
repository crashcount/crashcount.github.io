Six with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last year, Bronx CB7 streets have not grown kinder. A 65-year-old man, crossing with the light at University Avenue and West Kingsbridge Road, was crushed by a turning van. A 39-year-old driver, stranded on the Major Deegan, was rear-ended and left to die while the other driver ran into the dark. His friends were on their way to help. He called them, gasping for breath, after the crash. He did not make it. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>“He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run. They were on their way to come give him a jump and he got hit waiting for them. And then he called to let them know, I&rsquo;ve been hit. I can&rsquo;t breathe.”</a></p><p><strong>Eight killed. Twenty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, these are the numbers. They do not count the families who wait for a phone call that never comes. They do not count the children who limp to school, or the elders who fear the crosswalk.</p><h2 id=the-machinery-of-harm>The Machinery of Harm</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> Seventy-nine pedestrians were struck by cars or SUVs. Vans killed two. An ambulance killed one. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about lowering speed limits. They talk about cameras. But the dead keep coming. <strong>No new laws from local leaders have stopped the bleeding here.</strong></p><p>Police say they are looking for the man who ran after killing Darryl Mathis. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>Police said Monday they were looking for a man who ran away after crashing his car into a disabled vehicle on the Major Deegan Expressway and killing its driver over the weekend.</a></p><p><strong>There is no comfort in words. There is only the next crash.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another friend to call for help and never speak again. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary: 'The City Council approved Albany's extension and expansion of New York's speed camera program, allowing cameras to operate 24/7, but not before several council members voiced opposition.' Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.'
