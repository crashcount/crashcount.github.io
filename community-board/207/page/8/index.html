Six with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last year, Bronx CB7 streets have not grown kinder. A 65-year-old man, crossing with the light at University Avenue and West Kingsbridge Road, was crushed by a turning van. A 39-year-old driver, stranded on the Major Deegan, was rear-ended and left to die while the other driver ran into the dark. His friends were on their way to help. He called them, gasping for breath, after the crash. He did not make it. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>“He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run. They were on their way to come give him a jump and he got hit waiting for them. And then he called to let them know, I&rsquo;ve been hit. I can&rsquo;t breathe.”</a></p><p><strong>Eight killed. Twenty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, these are the numbers. They do not count the families who wait for a phone call that never comes. They do not count the children who limp to school, or the elders who fear the crosswalk.</p><h2 id=the-machinery-of-harm>The Machinery of Harm</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> Seventy-nine pedestrians were struck by cars or SUVs. Vans killed two. An ambulance killed one. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They talk about lowering speed limits. They talk about cameras. But the dead keep coming. <strong>No new laws from local leaders have stopped the bleeding here.</strong></p><p>Police say they are looking for the man who ran after killing Darryl Mathis. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>Police said Monday they were looking for a man who ran away after crashing his car into a disabled vehicle on the Major Deegan Expressway and killing its driver over the weekend.</a></p><p><strong>There is no comfort in words. There is only the next crash.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another friend to call for help and never speak again. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assemblymembers Phil Steck (District 110, primary sponsor) and Angelo Santabarbara (District 111, co-sponsor) led the push. The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028."

The matter title reads: "Resolution calling on the State legislature to increase the cap on commercial overnight fines for cities." Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking. The resolution points to nearly 27,000 complaints in 2021 and notes that current enforcement tools are weak.

The official summary reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to conduct a pilot project on the use of cool pavement.' Council Member Selvena N.

Speeds lag under 5 mph. Riders stew in delays. Council Member Feliz now backs bus lanes. Community leaders push for bold moves. DOT promises a plan, but trust runs thin after past failures.</p><p class=mb3>On May 6, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) considered improvements for the Bronx’s Tremont Avenue bus corridor. The matter, discussed with Bronx Community Boards 5 and 6, is titled: “City Considers Fixes for Another Ridiculously Slow Cross-Bronx Bus.” Council Member Oswald Feliz, who once opposed a Fordham Road bus lane, now supports dedicated lanes on Tremont. Council Member Pierina Sanchez also represents the area. Residents and riders call the Bx36 the slowest bus in the Bronx, citing delays and crowding. DOT data shows no speed gains since 2022. The corridor’s narrow lanes and parking worsen congestion and danger. Community leaders urge a busway or bus/truck-only stretch. DOT plans traffic analysis through summer 2024, with a proposal due later. The agency claims its top priority is “fast, reliable, and on-time” bus service, but skepticism remains after past inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
