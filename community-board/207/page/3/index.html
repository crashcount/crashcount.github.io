The SUV’s right rear bumper cracked from the impact. The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor, and notes the moped driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash. No contributing factors are attributed to the SUV driver. The focus remains on the systemic danger of unlicensed, speeding drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Their request, sent to the Department of Transportation before the crash, was denied due to low car volumes and insufficient crash history. The lawmakers, at a press conference, supported speed humps and stop signs but opposed road diets and universal daylighting. Eric Dinowitz argued, 'If you walked down any of these streets, they are far too narrow to narrow any more.' He also rejected citywide daylighting, insisting, 'Daylighting has to be done corner by corner.' The council member has criticized DOT’s safety efforts before, framing the agency as unresponsive.
