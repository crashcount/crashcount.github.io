The area saw at least 246 crashes, 358 injuries, and two deaths since 2011. The plan, stalled for 17 years, will shorten crossings, add sidewalks, and upgrade signals. The corridor serves schools, bus stops, and parks. DDC spokesperson Ian Michaels called it an 'incredibly complex project.' Delays left vulnerable road users exposed. The redesign aims to reduce conflict and injury at a site long marked by systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
