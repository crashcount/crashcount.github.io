The debate follows congestion pricing, which, as the bill summary states, has made free street parking uptown scarce and pushed more drivers into residential neighborhoods. State Senator Robert Jackson sponsors a parallel bill in Albany. De La Rosa and Jackson argue that local residents lose parking to out-of-state drivers. Councilmember Gale Brewer warns that low permit prices could increase car ownership and worsen parking shortages, citing past failures in other cities. Kate Slevin of the Regional Plan Association questions whether a permit system would be enforced, given the city's history of placard abuse.

No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."
