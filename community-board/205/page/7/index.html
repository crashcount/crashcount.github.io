But the streets did not spare the living. In the past twelve months, 604 people were hurt in crashes here. Seven suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is immune. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn and plowed into six people at East 149th and Courtlandt. The car mounted the sidewalk. The driver ran. Six went to the hospital. Police are still looking for the man who did this. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx</a>, the report read. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><p>Last year, a driver ran over a man at a Bronx gas station, dragged him nearly a thousand feet, stopped, looked, and left him behind. The Bronx District Attorney called it &ldquo;egregious and show[ing] a lack of humanity.&rdquo; The defendant allegedly <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/23/bronx-hit-run-driver-arrested-2-years-after-dragging-pedestrian-950-feet-to-death-da/>drove her car over the victim&mldr; then after looking under her vehicle&mldr; she allegedly drove away without reporting what happened</a>.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-harm>The Vehicles That Harm</h2><p>Cars and SUVs did the most damage. They killed two pedestrians and left nine with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one and hurt more. Motorcycles and mopeds struck dozens. Even bikes are not blameless. The street is a gauntlet, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. These are good moves. But the carnage continues. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph now. It has not. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every delay is another body on the street. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The aim: fewer crashes, safer streets for all.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly bill A 5440 was introduced on February 14, 2025, and is in the sponsorship stage. The bill, titled "Imposes owner liability for failure of an operator to comply with traffic control indicators within the city of New York," seeks to hold vehicle owners accountable when their cars violate traffic signals, using camera enforcement. Assembly Member Steven Raga sponsors the bill, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Tony Simone, Yudelka Tapia, Karines Reyes, and Marcela Mitaynes as co-sponsors. No safety analyst note is available. The bill aims to curb dangerous driving and protect vulnerable road users by making owners answer for violations caught on camera.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
