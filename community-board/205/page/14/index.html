The driver, alone, drifted asleep and never woke. Smoke curled above the wreck. No other lives touched. The morning street bore witness to a solitary fatal mistake.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 27-year-old man driving a Nissan SUV on Jerome Avenue near 1709 lost control of his vehicle after he 'fell asleep at the wheel.' The SUV struck head-on, resulting in the driver’s death. The report states the crash occurred in the early morning, with the street described as 'still' and 'nothing moved but the smoke.' The only person involved was the driver, who died alone in the vehicle. The police report explicitly lists 'Fell Asleep' as the contributing factor, underscoring the critical role of driver inattention and fatigue in this fatal incident. No other vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists were involved or harmed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Speeds lag under 5 mph. Riders stew in delays. Council Member Feliz now backs bus lanes. Community leaders push for bold moves. DOT promises a plan, but trust runs thin after past failures.</p><p class=mb3>On May 6, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) considered improvements for the Bronx’s Tremont Avenue bus corridor. The matter, discussed with Bronx Community Boards 5 and 6, is titled: “City Considers Fixes for Another Ridiculously Slow Cross-Bronx Bus.” Council Member Oswald Feliz, who once opposed a Fordham Road bus lane, now supports dedicated lanes on Tremont. Council Member Pierina Sanchez also represents the area. Residents and riders call the Bx36 the slowest bus in the Bronx, citing delays and crowding. DOT data shows no speed gains since 2022. The corridor’s narrow lanes and parking worsen congestion and danger. Community leaders urge a busway or bus/truck-only stretch. DOT plans traffic analysis through summer 2024, with a proposal due later. The agency claims its top priority is “fast, reliable, and on-time” bus service, but skepticism remains after past inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
