A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the scooter riders. Both men were thrown from their scooters and died at the hospital. Police arrested the driver for vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The highway closed for hours. The city kept moving.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person was killed and 642 were injured</strong> in crashes in Bronx CB5. Seven suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared—52 kids hurt, none killed, but luck is not a plan. The numbers do not stop. They do not care.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead and injured are not just numbers. They are people crossing the street, riding home, walking to work. Most never make the news. But the pain is real. The city’s own data shows <strong>cars and SUVs caused the most harm</strong>—three deaths, nine serious injuries, and hundreds more hurt. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—all play their part, but the weight of steel falls hardest from behind a wheel.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders act. State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>&ldquo;improves child pedestrian safety&rdquo;</a>. They also backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. But the law is not yet passed. The streets are not yet safe.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day for another family to lose someone they love.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with those who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The dead cannot speak.

The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.

The driver of the Cadillac, a male with a valid New York license, was injured, sustaining contusions and bruises to his shoulder and upper arm. The report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor to the crash. The parked GMC sedan had no occupants at the time. The collision underscores the systemic danger posed by driver distraction, which led to the failure to maintain control and avoid a stationary vehicle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The driver’s inattention caused the collision, highlighting dangers posed by distracted driving in urban streets.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, at 3:26 AM in the Bronx near 1721 Grand Ave, a Station Wagon/SUV traveling south struck a 36-year-old female pedestrian. The pedestrian was emerging from in front of or behind a parked vehicle when the collision occurred. The impact was to the center front end of the SUV, causing chest injuries including fractures and dislocations to the pedestrian, who remained conscious. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, indicating the driver failed to maintain proper attention to the roadway. The pedestrian’s confusion or error in emerging from behind the parked vehicle was also noted but driver distraction was the primary cause. No helmet or crossing signal factors were reported. This crash underscores the systemic danger posed by distracted driving in areas where pedestrians may appear unexpectedly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
