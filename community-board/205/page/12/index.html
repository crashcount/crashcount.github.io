A sedan crushes him. He dies there, on the concrete, at 2:37 a.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>. Another man, 27, falls asleep behind the wheel on Jerome Avenue. His SUV slams, center front, into the night. He does not wake up. Police <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>were looking for a suspect</a> who ran after killing a driver on the Deegan. The dead man was the first traffic fatality in the precinct this year. The Mercedes driver left on foot. The city kept moving.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, Bronx CB5 saw 631 crashes, 460 injuries, and 5 people left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. One died.</strong></p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-bleed>The Numbers That Don’t Bleed</h2><p>Children are not spared. Seventeen under 18 were hurt this year. Forty-seven people aged 35 to 44 were injured. The numbers pile up. They do not make a sound. Cars and SUVs caused the most pain—93 incidents, 2 deaths, 8 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, left six with broken bodies. Motorcycles and mopeds, 18 crashes, one serious injury. Bikes, two crashes, one serious injury. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=promises-and-power>Promises and Power</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets. But the dead stay dead.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. It lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. It is not yet citywide. The law sits, waiting for leaders to act. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The city says, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>said the Mayor</a>. The numbers say more.</p><h2 id=the-silence>The Silence</h2><p>No council member stands in the street. No press release for the man who died at 2:37 a.m. No comfort for the families who wait for a call that never comes. <strong>The silence is the policy. The silence is the plan.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras on every deadly block. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
