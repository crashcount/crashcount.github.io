A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the scooter riders. Both men were thrown from their scooters and died at the hospital. Police arrested the driver for vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The highway closed for hours. The city kept moving.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person was killed and 642 were injured</strong> in crashes in Bronx CB5. Seven suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared—52 kids hurt, none killed, but luck is not a plan. The numbers do not stop. They do not care.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead and injured are not just numbers. They are people crossing the street, riding home, walking to work. Most never make the news. But the pain is real. The city’s own data shows <strong>cars and SUVs caused the most harm</strong>—three deaths, nine serious injuries, and hundreds more hurt. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—all play their part, but the weight of steel falls hardest from behind a wheel.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders act. State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>&ldquo;improves child pedestrian safety&rdquo;</a>. They also backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. But the law is not yet passed. The streets are not yet safe.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day for another family to lose someone they love.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with those who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The dead cannot speak.

The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the boy was crossing the street outside a crosswalk and without a signal when the SUV, traveling at an unsafe speed, hit him head-on. The impact caused severe bleeding from his arm, but he remained conscious at the scene. Police explicitly cite 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the crash. The driver was traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred, and the vehicle’s center front end struck the boy. The police report does not list any pedestrian actions as contributing factors, focusing solely on the driver’s unsafe speed. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of excessive speed on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
