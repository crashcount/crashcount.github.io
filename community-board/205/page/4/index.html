A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the scooter riders. Both men were thrown from their scooters and died at the hospital. Police arrested the driver for vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The highway closed for hours. The city kept moving.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person was killed and 642 were injured</strong> in crashes in Bronx CB5. Seven suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared—52 kids hurt, none killed, but luck is not a plan. The numbers do not stop. They do not care.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead and injured are not just numbers. They are people crossing the street, riding home, walking to work. Most never make the news. But the pain is real. The city’s own data shows <strong>cars and SUVs caused the most harm</strong>—three deaths, nine serious injuries, and hundreds more hurt. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—all play their part, but the weight of steel falls hardest from behind a wheel.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders act. State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>&ldquo;improves child pedestrian safety&rdquo;</a>. They also backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. But the law is not yet passed. The streets are not yet safe.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day for another family to lose someone they love.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with those who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The dead cannot speak.

Repeat speeders face forced installation of speed assistance tech. Eleven points or six camera tickets triggers action. Law targets reckless drivers. Streets may get safer for those outside the car.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 4045, sponsored by Andrew Gounardes and co-sponsored by over two dozen senators, passed committee votes on June 11 and June 12, 2025. The bill, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' mandates these devices for drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red light camera tickets in a year. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving. Senators including Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, and others voted yes. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
