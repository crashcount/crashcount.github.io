But the streets did not spare the living. In the past twelve months, 604 people were hurt in crashes here. Seven suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is immune. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn and plowed into six people at East 149th and Courtlandt. The car mounted the sidewalk. The driver ran. Six went to the hospital. Police are still looking for the man who did this. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx</a>, the report read. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><p>Last year, a driver ran over a man at a Bronx gas station, dragged him nearly a thousand feet, stopped, looked, and left him behind. The Bronx District Attorney called it &ldquo;egregious and show[ing] a lack of humanity.&rdquo; The defendant allegedly <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/23/bronx-hit-run-driver-arrested-2-years-after-dragging-pedestrian-950-feet-to-death-da/>drove her car over the victim&mldr; then after looking under her vehicle&mldr; she allegedly drove away without reporting what happened</a>.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-harm>The Vehicles That Harm</h2><p>Cars and SUVs did the most damage. They killed two pedestrians and left nine with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one and hurt more. Motorcycles and mopeds struck dozens. Even bikes are not blameless. The street is a gauntlet, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have taken steps. Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. These are good moves. But the carnage continues. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph now. It has not. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every delay is another body on the street. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter: 'Bus Advocates Target Anti-Busway ‘Hypocrites’ at Bronx Zoo and Botanical Garden.' Council Member Pierina Sanchez noted 70 percent of her district’s residents lack cars. The institutions sent a private letter to Mayor Adams, urging him to block all bus improvements. Riders Alliance and local residents accused them of hypocrisy, citing their public support for transit and environmental causes. The Botanical Garden’s representative demanded an Environmental Impact Statement, citing fears of more car traffic and pollution. Surveys show most Fordham Road shoppers walk or use transit.

Bowed to business and institutional pressure. Riders lose. Offset bus lanes will replace the plan. Bus speeds will rise less. Bronx transit users, mostly car-free, get crumbs. Political muscle wins. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) canceled the Fordham Road busway plan, citing 'community concerns.' The matter, discussed with the community advisory board on May 31, shifted focus to extending offset bus lanes instead. Council Member Pierina Sanchez, representing Kingsbridge, criticized the move: "My concern with the offset bus lane is that we're not going to see significant improvements." DOT's own studies showed a busway would have improved speeds by 30 percent, but the agency predicts only a 20 percent gain with the new plan. The decision followed lobbying from business groups and institutions, despite surveys showing most Bronx residents rely on transit. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein called the cancellation a disservice to bus riders. The change leaves 85,000 daily commuters with slower buses and no real safety or speed gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
