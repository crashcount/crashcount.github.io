An SUV turned into a driveway and struck her. The driver did not stop. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. Police are still searching for the person who left her in the street. Police described how <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/us-news/44-year-old-woman-killed-in-nyc-hit-and-run-by-reckless-driver-turning-into-driveway/>a 44-year-old woman was fatally mowed down by a reckless driver who struck her while turning into a Bronx driveway before zooming off</a>. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-kills-bronx-pedestrian-flees-the-scene-nypd-says>Police said they&rsquo;re looking for the driver of a vehicle who struck and killed a woman as she crossed a Bronx street late Wednesday night and then fled the scene</a>.</p><p>This is not rare. It is routine. In the past 12 months, Bronx CB5 saw 827 crashes, 633 injuries, and 8 people left with life-altering wounds. Six have died since 2022. Most were walking. Most never saw it coming.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did the most harm. Sedans alone killed two and injured over 100 pedestrians. SUVs and trucks followed close behind, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, 52 people under 18 were hurt.

Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia and State Senator Gustavo Rivera both voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. But the city still drags its feet on lowering the default speed limit to 20 mph. The council could act today. They have not.</p><p>The carnage continues. The law lets the city slow the streets. The city waits. Each day of delay is another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Do not wait for another body in the road. The city will not move unless you make them.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bronx Democrat Pierina Sanchez introduced the measure, stating, 'I am the daughter and granddaughter of street vendors.' The bill aims to replace criminal charges with fines and remove barriers for thousands of vendors. Mayor Eric Adams opposes lifting the cap, citing sidewalk crowding. The matter summary: 'change may be coming for the thousands of street vendors operating in New York City.' Safety analysts note that easing restrictions can boost pedestrian activity and street presence, creating 'safety in numbers' and calming traffic.

According to the article, Campbell's family said he tried to resolve the crash through insurance, but the suspect demanded money and then opened fire. ABC7 quotes Campbell’s father: "If you have insurance, you use insurance. Stop jumping out of car and shooting people."
