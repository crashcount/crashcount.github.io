A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the scooter riders. Both men were thrown from their scooters and died at the hospital. Police arrested the driver for vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The highway closed for hours. The city kept moving.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person was killed and 642 were injured</strong> in crashes in Bronx CB5. Seven suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared—52 kids hurt, none killed, but luck is not a plan. The numbers do not stop. They do not care.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead and injured are not just numbers. They are people crossing the street, riding home, walking to work. Most never make the news. But the pain is real. The city’s own data shows <strong>cars and SUVs caused the most harm</strong>—three deaths, nine serious injuries, and hundreds more hurt. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—all play their part, but the weight of steel falls hardest from behind a wheel.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders act. State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia both voted to extend school speed zones, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>&ldquo;improves child pedestrian safety&rdquo;</a>. They also backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. But the law is not yet passed. The streets are not yet safe.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day for another family to lose someone they love.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with those who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The dead cannot speak.

The matter: 'Bus Advocates Target Anti-Busway ‘Hypocrites’ at Bronx Zoo and Botanical Garden.' Council Member Pierina Sanchez noted 70 percent of her district’s residents lack cars. The institutions sent a private letter to Mayor Adams, urging him to block all bus improvements. Riders Alliance and local residents accused them of hypocrisy, citing their public support for transit and environmental causes. The Botanical Garden’s representative demanded an Environmental Impact Statement, citing fears of more car traffic and pollution. Surveys show most Fordham Road shoppers walk or use transit.

Bowed to business and institutional pressure. Riders lose. Offset bus lanes will replace the plan. Bus speeds will rise less. Bronx transit users, mostly car-free, get crumbs. Political muscle wins. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) canceled the Fordham Road busway plan, citing 'community concerns.' The matter, discussed with the community advisory board on May 31, shifted focus to extending offset bus lanes instead. Council Member Pierina Sanchez, representing Kingsbridge, criticized the move: "My concern with the offset bus lane is that we're not going to see significant improvements." DOT's own studies showed a busway would have improved speeds by 30 percent, but the agency predicts only a 20 percent gain with the new plan. The decision followed lobbying from business groups and institutions, despite surveys showing most Bronx residents rely on transit. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein called the cancellation a disservice to bus riders. The change leaves 85,000 daily commuters with slower buses and no real safety or speed gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
