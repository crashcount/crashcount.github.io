An SUV turned into a driveway and struck her. The driver did not stop. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. Police are still searching for the person who left her in the street. Police described how <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/us-news/44-year-old-woman-killed-in-nyc-hit-and-run-by-reckless-driver-turning-into-driveway/>a 44-year-old woman was fatally mowed down by a reckless driver who struck her while turning into a Bronx driveway before zooming off</a>. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-kills-bronx-pedestrian-flees-the-scene-nypd-says>Police said they&rsquo;re looking for the driver of a vehicle who struck and killed a woman as she crossed a Bronx street late Wednesday night and then fled the scene</a>.</p><p>This is not rare.

SUVs and trucks followed close behind, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared.

Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia and State Senator Gustavo Rivera both voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. But the city still drags its feet on lowering the default speed limit to 20 mph. The council could act today. They have not.</p><p>The carnage continues. The law lets the city slow the streets. The city waits. Each day of delay is another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Do not wait for another body in the road.

Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa, representing District 10, advanced a bill to allow food carts within two feet of the curb, instead of forcing them to abut traffic. The hearing, covered by Gothamist, saw rare agreement on banning vending in bike lanes and bridges, but fierce debate over location rules. The matter summary reads: 'NY street vendors and store owners, sometimes rivals, find some common ground.' De La Rosa’s bill aims to reduce danger for vendors forced close to traffic. Erin Piscopink of the NYC BID Association warned of unclear obstruction definitions and overcrowding. Councilmember Pierina Sanchez, another leader, called for real permit reform. The bills, part of a sweeping package, could come to a vote this year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
