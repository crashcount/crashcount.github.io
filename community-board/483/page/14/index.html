In Queens CB83, <strong>43 people have been injured in 67 crashes</strong> since 2022. Not one death. But pain lingers. Broken arms, whiplash, concussions. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last twelve months, <strong>16 more injuries</strong>. No one is spared: young, old, working, waiting. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>A man died on the Belt Parkway near JFK. He lost control. The car hit a tree. He never made it home. Police found him at the scene. No arrests. The case is still open. The story ran cold in the news, but the loss is not forgotten. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>Police from the 106th Precinct in South Ozone Park responded to a 911 call of a motor vehicle collision on the westbound Belt Parkway just west of 130th Street just after 10:30 p.m.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>No local leader has stepped forward with a bold plan.</strong> No new bills, no public votes, no press quotes from the council or Albany. The silence is heavy. The city has the power to lower speed limits. They have not used it here. Cameras could catch speeders, but the law is at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program is gone. The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not. The cost is measured in broken bodies and empty beds.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary: 'In Astoria, Queens, 14 possible transit options for connecting to LaGuardia Airport were presented at a public comment session.' Council Member Larinda Hooks (District 35) voiced support for the original AirTrain, ferry service, and other mass transit options, but opposed removing parking or traffic lanes. Hooks said, 'The original plan is still the best plan... It doesn’t go near anybody’s house.' The process continues. No final plan.

Two hundred seventy-three people died on New York streets. Hit-and-runs soared. SUVs killed more. Brooklyn bled most. Leaders promise fixes. Streets remain deadly. Urgency fills the air. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>A final analysis released January 26, 2022, revealed 2021 as the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative, with 273 road deaths—a 32 percent jump from 2018. The Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, faces mounting pressure. The matter summary states: 'A final analysis of 2021 crash statistics revealed that it was the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative.' Transportation Alternatives demanded urgent action: reclaiming street space from cars, redesigning intersections, upgrading bike lanes, and more. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez pledged intersection redesigns and stronger bike lanes, but no changes have rolled out. Brooks-Powers called every death 'an avoidable tragedy' and vowed to push for safer streets. The city stands at a crossroads. Vulnerable road users pay the price for delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul backs a new train line linking Queens and Brooklyn. The Interborough Express uses old tracks for new rapid transit. Borough presidents Richards and Reynoso support it. The plan faces cost, freight, and construction hurdles. Public review comes next.</p><p class=mb3>On January 21, 2022, Gov. Hochul announced the Interborough Express (IBX) project, a new train line connecting Bay Ridge in Brooklyn to Jackson Heights in Queens. The project is in early stages, with environmental review and public input ahead. The MTA’s feasibility study considered light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit, aiming for a 45-minute end-to-end trip. The matter summary states: 'New York City is getting a new train line, the Interborough Express (IBX), thanks to Gov. Hochul's support for passenger service on the rail right of way connecting Queens and Brooklyn.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso voiced support at the announcement. The project uses existing right-of-way, avoiding eminent domain, but faces challenges with freight integration, track upgrades, and uncertain costs. Modular station designs aim to keep expenses down. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users has been published.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates watch closely.</p><p class=mb3>On January 20, 2022, Selvena Brooks-Powers became chair of the City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. She represents District 31 in southeast Queens, an area with limited transit and high car use. The committee oversees key street safety and mobility issues. Brooks-Powers said, 'Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.' She supports expanding protected bike lanes, bus lanes, open streets, and ferry access, but has mixed views on dedicated bus lanes due to local bottlenecks. Brooks-Powers plans to consult with colleagues, advocates, and experts in her first 100 days to address traffic violence and congestion. Advocates are optimistic, citing her record fighting for communities and workers.
