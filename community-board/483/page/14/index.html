The law aims to bypass restrictive federal guidelines that block safety fixes. Council members and residents blasted DOT for slow, arbitrary action and years of denied requests, sometimes only reversed after tragedy.

Transportation Alternatives demanded urgent action: reclaiming street space from cars, redesigning intersections, upgrading bike lanes, and more. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez pledged intersection redesigns and stronger bike lanes, but no changes have rolled out. Brooks-Powers called every death 'an avoidable tragedy' and vowed to push for safer streets. The city stands at a crossroads. Vulnerable road users pay the price for delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul backs a new train line linking Queens and Brooklyn. The Interborough Express uses old tracks for new rapid transit. Borough presidents Richards and Reynoso support it. The plan faces cost, freight, and construction hurdles. Public review comes next.</p><p class=mb3>On January 21, 2022, Gov. Hochul announced the Interborough Express (IBX) project, a new train line connecting Bay Ridge in Brooklyn to Jackson Heights in Queens. The project is in early stages, with environmental review and public input ahead. The MTA’s feasibility study considered light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit, aiming for a 45-minute end-to-end trip. The matter summary states: 'New York City is getting a new train line, the Interborough Express (IBX), thanks to Gov. Hochul's support for passenger service on the rail right of way connecting Queens and Brooklyn.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso voiced support at the announcement. The project uses existing right-of-way, avoiding eminent domain, but faces challenges with freight integration, track upgrades, and uncertain costs. Modular station designs aim to keep expenses down. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users has been published.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates watch closely.</p><p class=mb3>On January 20, 2022, Selvena Brooks-Powers became chair of the City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. She represents District 31 in southeast Queens, an area with limited transit and high car use. The committee oversees key street safety and mobility issues. Brooks-Powers said, 'Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.' She supports expanding protected bike lanes, bus lanes, open streets, and ferry access, but has mixed views on dedicated bus lanes due to local bottlenecks. Brooks-Powers plans to consult with colleagues, advocates, and experts in her first 100 days to address traffic violence and congestion. Advocates are optimistic, citing her record fighting for communities and workers. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
