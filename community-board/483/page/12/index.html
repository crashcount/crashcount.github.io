In Queens CB83, <strong>43 people have been injured in 67 crashes</strong> since 2022. Not one death. But pain lingers. Broken arms, whiplash, concussions. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last twelve months, <strong>16 more injuries</strong>. No one is spared: young, old, working, waiting. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>A man died on the Belt Parkway near JFK. He lost control. The car hit a tree. He never made it home. Police found him at the scene. No arrests. The case is still open. The story ran cold in the news, but the loss is not forgotten. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>Police from the 106th Precinct in South Ozone Park responded to a 911 call of a motor vehicle collision on the westbound Belt Parkway just west of 130th Street just after 10:30 p.m.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>No local leader has stepped forward with a bold plan.</strong> No new bills, no public votes, no press quotes from the council or Albany. The silence is heavy. The city has the power to lower speed limits. They have not used it here. Cameras could catch speeders, but the law is at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program is gone. The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not. The cost is measured in broken bodies and empty beds.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation.

The exchange escalated, drawing condemnation from other officials. The matter centered on the policy to charge motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Holden joined a bipartisan press conference urging Governor Hochul to let voters decide.

The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements.

Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation.

Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.'

Asphalt traps water. Storms turn roads into rivers. Bioswales and trees soak up rain, protect homes, keep subways dry. The city must swap pavement for life. Action saves lives, not parking.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2022, the Council Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, discussed flood prevention. An opinion from a Transportation Alternatives staffer urged the Council to 'transform impervious driving lanes into green climate solutions.' The piece calls for bioswales and greenspace in place of parking, citing the deadly floods after Hurricane Ida. It highlights that 72 percent of city land is impervious, worsening flash floods. The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge. The message is clear: 'Our streets can become the solution to climate change and flooding.' No council vote occurred, but the advocacy pushes for urgent, systemic change to protect New Yorkers from future storms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want trains running where weeds grow. They reject inflated costs. They say transit equity matters. They press for action, not delay. Riders wait. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On August 5, 2022, fifteen elected officials and two community board chairs from Queens signed a letter demanding Governor Hochul and Mayor Adams fund an environmental impact study (EIS) for the QueensLink subway expansion. The proposal, discussed in the City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, seeks to restore service on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch, connecting Rego Park and Ozone Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, emphasized, 'Transportation equity is a major issue in our city that must be confronted.' The letter criticizes the MTA’s previous cost estimates and compares QueensLink’s need to the state-backed Interborough Express. Supporters argue that if the state can spend $1 billion widening the Van Wyck Expressway, it can fund a study for transit. The EIS would include community engagement to address local concerns. The push is clear: more transit, fewer cars, safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference.
