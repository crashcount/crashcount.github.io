In Queens CB83, <strong>43 people have been injured in 67 crashes</strong> since 2022. Not one death. But pain lingers. Broken arms, whiplash, concussions. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last twelve months, <strong>16 more injuries</strong>. No one is spared: young, old, working, waiting. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>A man died on the Belt Parkway near JFK. He lost control. The car hit a tree. He never made it home. Police found him at the scene. No arrests. The case is still open. The story ran cold in the news, but the loss is not forgotten. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>Police from the 106th Precinct in South Ozone Park responded to a 911 call of a motor vehicle collision on the westbound Belt Parkway just west of 130th Street just after 10:30 p.m.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>No local leader has stepped forward with a bold plan.</strong> No new bills, no public votes, no press quotes from the council or Albany. The silence is heavy. The city has the power to lower speed limits. They have not used it here. Cameras could catch speeders, but the law is at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program is gone. The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not. The cost is measured in broken bodies and empty beds.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation.

Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress.

Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The primary sponsor was Kristin Richardson Jordan, joined by Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Julie Won, Rita C. Joseph, Crystal Hudson, Farah N. Louis, and Lincoln Restler. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users.

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
