In Queens CB83, <strong>43 people have been injured in 67 crashes</strong> since 2022. Not one death. But pain lingers. Broken arms, whiplash, concussions. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last twelve months, <strong>16 more injuries</strong>. No one is spared: young, old, working, waiting. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>A man died on the Belt Parkway near JFK. He lost control. The car hit a tree. He never made it home. Police found him at the scene. No arrests. The case is still open. The story ran cold in the news, but the loss is not forgotten. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>Police from the 106th Precinct in South Ozone Park responded to a 911 call of a motor vehicle collision on the westbound Belt Parkway just west of 130th Street just after 10:30 p.m.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>No local leader has stepped forward with a bold plan.</strong> No new bills, no public votes, no press quotes from the council or Albany. The silence is heavy. The city has the power to lower speed limits. They have not used it here. Cameras could catch speeders, but the law is at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program is gone. The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not. The cost is measured in broken bodies and empty beds.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), committee chair, sponsored the bill. The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler said, 'My top priority is expanding street safety.' The bill now requires a digital training course and valid ID for complainants. Only unoccupied cars can be reported.

They demanded daylighting, neckdowns, speed bumps, stop signs, and reflective markings at Newtown Road intersections. The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces. Advocates and experts agree: daylighting without barriers is flawed. They call for curb extensions to slow drivers and protect people.
