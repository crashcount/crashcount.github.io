The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not.

It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone.

The program, mandated by a 2021 law, will run for three years in two phases. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'These hubs will help better organize last-mile deliveries and support small and large businesses’ economic recovery.' The hubs will be chosen for proximity to bike lanes, truck routes, and transit, with community input. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers backed the plan, citing the need to reduce truck traffic and its deadly toll. Brooks-Powers noted, 'Every year roughly 1,400 lives are lost prematurely because of preventable air pollution exacerbated by the explosion of local truck traffic.' The council leadership supports the initiative as a move toward sustainable, safer streets for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This initiative, required by a 2021 City Council law, aims to reduce truck traffic and organize last-mile deliveries. The matter summary states: 'The city will launch a pilot program testing neighborhood delivery microhubs across the five boroughs, aimed at reducing the surge of truck traffic.' Councilmember Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, representing District 31, emphasized the need for sustainable infrastructure to curb environmental justice impacts from truck congestion. The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026. Environmentalists and advocates support the move but note it does not address warehouse siting in vulnerable communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers expressed disappointment: 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT is not supporting any of the bills.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized city austerity and shrinking staff. Advocates, including Amy Cohen, said the bills 'don’t go nearly far enough.' The hearing exposed deep gaps between Council ambition, DOT capacity, and the urgent need for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On February 14, 2023, the City Council’s Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), held a hearing on a slate of street safety bills. The matter, titled 'DOT chief pushes back on City Council’s latest street safety proposals,' saw Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez oppose mandatory installation of bollards, safety signs near schools, reflective curbs, and speed bumps near senior centers. Brooks-Powers opened the hearing noting, 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT doesn’t support any of the bills that we’re looking to discuss today.' Street safety advocates, including Priscilla Afokoba and Amy Cohen, spoke in favor of the proposals, citing the 255 people killed by motorists in the previous year. The only consensus: a resolution to urge Albany to reduce the speed limit to 5 mph on Open Streets, with Governor Hochul signaling support. The hearing highlighted deep divides between the Council and DOT on protecting pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 14, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on a package of street safety bills. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers led the debate. The Adams administration, represented by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, opposed the bills, arguing, 'Streets are dynamic and conditions are constantly changing. We need to be nimble.' The bills would require DOT to install traffic calming near senior centers, daylight intersections, add school safety signs, study and install bollards, and increase crash reporting. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the mayor’s budget cuts, saying they undermine safety goals. Brooks-Powers pledged to advance the bills, stressing the need for hard infrastructure, especially in Black and Brown neighborhoods. DOT admitted it is behind on bus and bike lane targets. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but advocates insist better design saves lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Cabán, Hanif, Yeger, Brewer, Richardson Jordan, Avilés, Brooks-Powers, and Riley. The measure highlights research showing subway air holds two to seven times more hazardous particles than city streets. These pollutants, from grinding wheels and diesel soot, threaten riders and workers—especially lower-income, Black, Hispanic, and immigrant New Yorkers.

Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Alexa Avilés, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Kristin Richardson Jordan, and Lincoln Restler backed the measure. The bill increased penalties for businesses parking on sidewalks in M1 zones—$150 for a first offense, $500 for a second, $1,000 for more. It required DOT to study and install bollards to block cars from sidewalks. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023, without becoming law.
