Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the Transportation Committee, criticized Vision Zero’s uneven impact. The report, titled "NYC streets have gotten safer under Vision Zero – especially if you live in a white neighborhood," found that while traffic fatalities dropped citywide, majority-Black communities saw a 13% increase and Latino areas a 30% rise. Brooks-Powers said, "It is deeply concerning that communities of color are experiencing fatalities at higher rates." The report states, "It's clear the program has not been fully or effectively implemented in neighborhoods of color and with lower incomes." DOT spokesperson Anna Correa responded that recent plans focus more resources on high-poverty, non-white neighborhoods, but the safety gap persists. The data shows Vision Zero’s benefits depend on where you live—and who the city prioritizes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

With help from Bloomberg-backed advisors, they outpace larger rivals. Grants target pedestrian danger. Local leaders credit technical aid and strong stories. More small towns now chase life-saving funds.</p><p class=mb3>""The Cities signing up are smaller and often less well-resourced, and they’re drawing down bigger-than-average grants as a result of the technical assistance they’re getting. We’re really proud to be converting ambitions and dreams into winning applications and real safety on the ground."" -- Khaleel Anderson</p><p class=mb3>On January 22, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported that small cities are securing major federal grants for street safety. Clarkston, Georgia, with high traffic-fatality rates, won $1 million from the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant to craft a safety plan. The Local Infrastructure Hub, co-led by Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides technical help, boosting applications. Mayor Beverley Burks of Clarkston said, "You have to be willing to invest in yourself as a city... Having someone who had the skillset to be able to help write the narrative – that’s very crucial for the reviewers to understand the needs in your community." James Anderson, also quoted, highlighted how technical assistance turns ambition into real safety. Other small cities, like Globe, Arizona, and Gladewater, Texas, have also won grants for pedestrian safety. These wins show federal money can reach vulnerable road users in overlooked places.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On January 12, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the failure of new concrete barriers meant to protect bike lanes on Park Avenue in the Bronx. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
