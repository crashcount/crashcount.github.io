The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not.

Drivers ignored them. Cars block both ends. Cyclists forced into traffic. Police rarely ticket. Council stalls on citizen reporting. The city’s fix failed. Cyclists pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On January 12, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the failure of new concrete barriers meant to protect bike lanes on Park Avenue in the Bronx. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Accountability is lacking.</p><p class=mb3>On December 28, 2023, Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers responded to the death of an 82-year-old cyclist killed by a hit-and-run truck on Northern Boulevard. This incident marked the 29th cyclist fatality in 2023, a grim milestone in a year of rising traffic violence. Brooks-Powers criticized the Adams administration and the Department of Transportation for failing to meet the Streets Plan's legal requirement of 50 miles of protected bike lanes, achieving only about 30 miles. She stated, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Brooks-Powers also condemned the missed bus lane targets and called out DOT's lack of transparency, pledging to hold the agency accountable and push for safer, more equitable streets. The city faces more cars, more crashes, and more injuries, while vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31) highlighted the deadly toll facing cyclists in New York City. The event, covered by amny.com, cited a study showing 25 bike riders killed since January, making this the deadliest year for cyclists since 1999. The matter summary states: 'New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999.' Brooks-Powers stressed the urgent need for investments in street infrastructure, especially in outer-borough communities. She joined advocates and fellow Council Member Diana Ayala in demanding the city fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets. The analysis found 94% of cyclist deaths occurred on streets without protected bike lanes. Activists and analysts called for immediate action to fast track the NYC Streets Plan and expand protected lanes, noting that only 3% of city streets have them, despite an 18.1% drop in injuries and deaths where they exist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Promises are not enough.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2023, a report spotlighted a deadly surge in cyclist fatalities across New York City, with District 31—represented by Council Transportation Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers—bearing the highest toll. The matter, titled 'Crunching the Data on the Record-Setting Year For Cyclist Deaths,' details that 94 percent of victims died on streets lacking protected bike lanes. Transportation Alternatives called on Brooks-Powers and her Council colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month wait and speed up bike lane construction. Brooks-Powers, mentioned as district representative, faces mounting pressure as advocates decry delays and demand urgent action. The report states: 'Promises won’t keep bike riders safe – but completed, fully protected bike lanes will. The time to act is now.' The city’s failure to meet the NYC Streets Plan benchmarks has left vulnerable road users exposed, with advocates urging immediate follow-through on essential street redesigns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic crashes in New York City killed more cyclists through the first nine months of 2023 than all but one other year on record.' Adams promised 75 miles of new protected bike lanes each year but delivered just 26.3 miles in 2022, missing the 30-mile benchmark and falling far short of the 50-mile requirement for 2023. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, accused Adams of putting 'politics over people' and called on Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month delay in bike lane construction. DOT spokesman Chris Browne defended the administration, citing nearly 100 street projects. But the report is clear: delays and broken promises leave cyclists exposed and dying.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, which launched in the Bronx in 2021, logged nearly 3 million trips with zero fatalities and few serious injuries in its first year. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Shared e-scooter service can play an important role in providing sustainable options to connect eastern Queens commuters to transit hubs, commercial corridors, and other neighborhood destinations." Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards both voiced support, highlighting the program's focus on underserved communities and environmental benefits. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged the city to pair the expansion with protected infrastructure, warning that safe streets must come with new mobility. The DOT will continue outreach ahead of the launch, expected in the second half of 2024.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
