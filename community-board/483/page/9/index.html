Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable.

The victim died on June 11. The crash happened in Council District 31, represented by Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers. The intersection lacks stop signs or a traffic light. A speed camera there issued over 600 tickets in 2021. Transportation Alternatives calls the district the city’s deadliest: six road deaths in early 2023, more than 10 percent of city fatalities, and the highest fatality rate per resident. The driver stayed at the scene. Police gave no details. No charges were filed. The street’s design and lack of enforcement leave pedestrians exposed and unprotected.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets open, but only for a while.</p><p class=mb3>On June 12, 2023, Mayor Adams announced the expansion of New York City’s Summer Streets program to all five boroughs. The program, managed by the Department of Transportation, will run on five Saturdays in July and August, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., covering 17 miles. Borough presidents Antonio Reynoso (Brooklyn) and Donovan Richards (Queens) pushed for this expansion, with Reynoso praising the use of major corridors like Eastern Parkway. Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing. The expansion marks a step forward, but the early end time leaves advocates wanting more.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Gutierrez led the charge. Brooks-Powers joined. Streets scarred by crashes and deaths. Lower speeds mean fewer bodies broken. The city waits. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, debated by the NYC Council and State Legislature, seeks home rule for New York City to lower speed limits from 25 to 20 mph on dangerous streets. Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.
