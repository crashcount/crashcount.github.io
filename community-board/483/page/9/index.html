In Queens CB83, <strong>43 people have been injured in 67 crashes</strong> since 2022. Not one death. But pain lingers. Broken arms, whiplash, concussions. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last twelve months, <strong>16 more injuries</strong>. No one is spared: young, old, working, waiting. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>A man died on the Belt Parkway near JFK. He lost control. The car hit a tree. He never made it home. Police found him at the scene. No arrests. The case is still open. The story ran cold in the news, but the loss is not forgotten. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>Police from the 106th Precinct in South Ozone Park responded to a 911 call of a motor vehicle collision on the westbound Belt Parkway just west of 130th Street just after 10:30 p.m.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>No local leader has stepped forward with a bold plan.</strong> No new bills, no public votes, no press quotes from the council or Albany. The silence is heavy. The city has the power to lower speed limits. They have not used it here. Cameras could catch speeders, but the law is at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program is gone. The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not. The cost is measured in broken bodies and empty beds.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The program, managed by the Department of Transportation, will run on five Saturdays in July and August, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., covering 17 miles. Borough presidents Antonio Reynoso (Brooklyn) and Donovan Richards (Queens) pushed for this expansion, with Reynoso praising the use of major corridors like Eastern Parkway. Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing. The expansion marks a step forward, but the early end time leaves advocates wanting more.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest.

Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

The bill failed to enter the 2023 state budget, shifting responsibility to the City Council. In 2021, the Council backed a home rule message 42-6, but the Assembly blocked it. Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing. The Council’s inaction keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), committee chair, sponsored the bill. The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
