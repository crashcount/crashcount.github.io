In Queens CB83, <strong>43 people have been injured in 67 crashes</strong> since 2022. Not one death. But pain lingers. Broken arms, whiplash, concussions. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last twelve months, <strong>16 more injuries</strong>. No one is spared: young, old, working, waiting. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>A man died on the Belt Parkway near JFK. He lost control. The car hit a tree. He never made it home. Police found him at the scene. No arrests. The case is still open. The story ran cold in the news, but the loss is not forgotten. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>Police from the 106th Precinct in South Ozone Park responded to a 911 call of a motor vehicle collision on the westbound Belt Parkway just west of 130th Street just after 10:30 p.m.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>No local leader has stepped forward with a bold plan.</strong> No new bills, no public votes, no press quotes from the council or Albany. The silence is heavy. The city has the power to lower speed limits. They have not used it here. Cameras could catch speeders, but the law is at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program is gone. The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not. The cost is measured in broken bodies and empty beds.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life. The bill's fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
