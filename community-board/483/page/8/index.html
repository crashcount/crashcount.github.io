The driver stayed at the scene. Police gave no details. No charges were filed.

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It called on the New York State Legislature and Governor to create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs), with funds aimed at expanding wheelchair-accessible and all-electric FHVs. The matter was introduced May 25, 2023, and filed at session’s end, never reaching enactment. The resolution’s title: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation that would create a surcharge for for-hire vehicles (FHVs) that would go towards funding the expansion of wheelchair accessible and all-electric FHVs.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, and Shahana K. Hanif sponsored the measure. The bill noted that only 4,858 of 95,129 FHVs were wheelchair accessible in 2022, and just 1% were all-electric.

She says it will clear bus and bike lanes. DOT officials push back. They say streets must serve all. Brooks-Powers opposes bus lanes and safety redesigns, even as deaths rise in her district.</p><p class=mb3>At a May 22, 2023 DOT budget hearing, Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for more municipal parking citywide. She argued, "DOT has a responsibility to also ensure that there also is parking, even municipal lots or garages available, as we look to share the street." Brooks-Powers claimed more parking would clear cars from bus and bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Executive Deputy Commissioner Paul Ochoa disagreed, stressing the need to share streets among all users. Brooks-Powers has opposed bus lane projects and a safety redesign in her own district, despite high traffic fatality rates. Her stance favors drivers, not vulnerable road users. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but her opposition to proven safety measures puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver.

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of traffic calming devices in senior pedestrian zones.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the bill, joined by co-sponsors including Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, and others. The council voted overwhelmingly in favor on April 27, 2023. The law requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to annually install at least one traffic calming device in each designated senior pedestrian zone, with a minimum of fifty devices citywide per year. DOT must report installation locations to the council every year. The law aims to slow traffic and protect older pedestrians where they are most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler and co-sponsored by a Council majority, was revised to remove cash bounties and require cars be unoccupied when reported. It now covers more area near schools. The NYPD, represented by Director of Legislative Affairs Michael Clarke, opposed the bill, warning of possible assaults and harassment. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said his agency is open to talks after earlier resistance. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, voiced concerns about public conflict. Restler insisted, 'People are dying on our streets. This will save lives.' Advocates remain divided. NYPD’s rare enforcement leaves bike lanes blocked, endangering vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On April 12, 2023, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams declined to support Sammy’s Law, a state bill allowing New York City to control its speed limits. The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. The law would not lower limits automatically, but grant the city authority to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
