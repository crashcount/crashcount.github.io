The policy, supported by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, escalates minor cycling infractions to criminal court summonses. The article, titled 'As NYPD’s Criminal Crackdown on Cyclists Expands, It Grows More Absurd: Victims,' details complaints of overzealous, inconsistent enforcement and alleged entrapment. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement, while Comptroller Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative' and dangerous. The safety analyst notes: 'Policies that empower discretionary or punitive enforcement against cyclists can deter active transportation, increase fear and mistrust, and shift responsibility away from systemic safety improvements, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.'

Cyclists report tickets for minor or fabricated infractions, including headphone use and stopping ahead of painted lines. Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative,' urging alternatives like the Idaho Stop and stricter delivery app regulation. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement and signaled interest in a hearing. The article notes e-bike riders cause few pedestrian injuries. The City Council previously limited criminal summonses for minor infractions over racial profiling concerns. Critics say the crackdown punishes vulnerable road users while failing to improve street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The department banned bikes from a major stretch of the Rockaway Boardwalk, closed parts of the Hudson River Greenway, and allowed cars back into Silver Lake Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, speaking for local families, condemned the boardwalk ban: "It was about the children that take advantage of biking on the boardwalk...We’re now shifting them into the street." Residents and advocates argue these moves ignore years of complaints about poor maintenance and lack of coordination with DOT. They highlight that car-free conditions in Silver Lake Park improved safety, especially for children. Advocates call for shifting road maintenance from Parks to DOT and demand structural changes.

Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection.
