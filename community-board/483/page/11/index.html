In Queens CB83, <strong>43 people have been injured in 67 crashes</strong> since 2022. Not one death. But pain lingers. Broken arms, whiplash, concussions. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. In the last twelve months, <strong>16 more injuries</strong>. No one is spared: young, old, working, waiting. The road does not care.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes>The Latest Crashes</h3><p>A man died on the Belt Parkway near JFK. He lost control. The car hit a tree. He never made it home. Police found him at the scene. No arrests. The case is still open. The story ran cold in the news, but the loss is not forgotten. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>Police from the 106th Precinct in South Ozone Park responded to a 911 call of a motor vehicle collision on the westbound Belt Parkway just west of 130th Street just after 10:30 p.m.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>No local leader has stepped forward with a bold plan.</strong> No new bills, no public votes, no press quotes from the council or Albany. The silence is heavy. The city has the power to lower speed limits. They have not used it here. Cameras could catch speeders, but the law is at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program is gone. The streets wait. So do the people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They can harden crosswalks. They can bring back the abatement program. But they have not. The cost is measured in broken bodies and empty beds.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooks-Powers (District 31) announced a forthcoming NYC Council hearing on obscured license plates and enforcement. The hearing, date not yet set, follows mounting evidence that drivers—including law enforcement—deface or cover plates to evade speed and toll cameras. The matter, described as a public safety issue, exposes a gap in city enforcement. Brooks-Powers’s action responds to calls for accountability, as highlighted in the article: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Despite City Hall’s claim that 'obscuring and defacing license plates is against the law' and that enforcement is increasing, the streets tell a different story. Unreadable plates let reckless drivers escape detection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater risk.

The matter title calls for 'a deeper study of the QueensLink proposal to reactivate an old rail line.' Ariola and Brooks-Powers, both representing southeastern Queens, argue the project would benefit communities with poor subway access and reduce car dependency. Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates.

The editorial dismissed equity concerns.</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2022, Councilman Robert F. Holden (District 30) was mentioned in a New York Post editorial opposing congestion pricing. The editorial, titled 'Hey, Donovan Richards: It’s actually way more racist to FAVOR congestion pricing,' criticized Queens Borough President Donovan Richards for labeling Holden’s opposition as racist. The piece argued, 'congestion pricing would be a disaster,' claiming it would harm diverse outer-borough residents and worsen air quality in The Bronx by diverting diesel trucks. The editorial cited MTA studies predicting only a 3.1% reduction in Manhattan traffic and framed the plan as an unfair tax on commerce. Holden’s stance reflects ongoing resistance to congestion pricing in the council, with equity and environmental impacts at the center of the debate. No formal council vote or bill was referenced in this editorial.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, the bill is advancing in the City Council with 24 out of 51 members signed on as of November 7, 2022. It sits with the Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, who is working with Restler to streamline the complaint process. The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users. The bill is seen as a major improvement over the ineffective 311 system.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible.

The exchange escalated, drawing condemnation from other officials. The matter centered on the policy to charge motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Holden joined a bipartisan press conference urging Governor Hochul to let voters decide. The spat revealed sharp divides over congestion pricing, with Holden opposing the plan and Richards defending it.

Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.'
