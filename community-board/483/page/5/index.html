The project, part of Vision Zero, was celebrated in Council District 26 with Council Member Julie Won present and helping secure $1.5 million for future upgrades. The redesign stretches from Queens Plaza to Hillside Avenue, creating the city’s longest protected bike lane. The DOT reports a 68% drop in fatalities and a 35% reduction in injuries since 2015. The redesign adds parking-protected bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and improved signals. The next phase, funded in part by Won, will replace painted lanes with concrete, add raised medians, and increase accessibility.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns.

No more waiting for blood on the asphalt.</p><p class=mb3>The planned overhaul targets the chaotic intersection of Beach 35th Street, Seagirt Boulevard, Rockaway Freeway, and Beach Channel Drive. Announced September 11, 2024, the $24.8 million project includes protected bike lanes, expanded sidewalks, and safer crossings. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $500,000, saying, "We're not waiting until someone loses their life to take action." Since 2019, 112 crashes have injured 54 people here—five of them pedestrians. The intersection currently favors cars, forcing pedestrians on long detours. The redesign will dead-end Beach 35th Street, add raised bike lanes, and expand pedestrian space. Final design is due next year, with construction set for 2027 and completion by 2029.

Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards supports removing parking mandates in high-density, transit-rich areas—like downtown Jamaica, Flushing, and Long Island City—saying, “Parking mandates in major transit hubs... should be eliminated, in order to increase housing opportunities there.” But he opposes ending parking mandates citywide, insisting they remain in low-density, outer transit-oriented development areas (OTODAs) due to infrequent Long Island Rail Road service and car dependence. Richards claims, “This is the reality of living in a transit desert.” The move splits the city, keeping car-centric policies in place for much of Queens. Housing advocates and the mayor’s office argue that citywide parking reform is needed to spur housing and reduce car reliance, but Richards’s stance preserves systemic danger for vulnerable road users in sprawling neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He backs lifting mandates in dense, transit-rich zones but blocks changes in car-dependent areas. Civic leaders echo him. The move keeps cars central, leaving pedestrians and cyclists exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2024, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards issued a public statement opposing the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity rezoning as it relates to eliminating mandatory parking requirements citywide. Richards said, "You can't use the one-size-fits-all approach here. There are really parts of Queens that are transit deserts." He supports removing parking mandates only in high-density, transit-rich areas, not in low-density, car-dependent neighborhoods. Community board leaders and civic groups in Queens joined him, arguing the reform threatens their way of life. Richards's stance contrasts with Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx officials, who support ending parking minimums. The decision preserves car dominance in Queens, leaving vulnerable road users at risk and blocking safer, people-first streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Thousands of jobs vanish. Local companies lose out. Lawmakers in affected districts stay silent or cheer. Trains and buses face deep cuts. Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group called for expanded lifeguard hours, more staff, and new public pools. The Adams administration rejected these measures, relying instead on NYPD drones and Parks Enforcement Patrols. The matter, described as 'Body found in fifth apparent drowning off NYC beach as pols call for more lifeguard hours,' highlights the deadly gap in city safety policy. Brannan, along with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough Presidents Donovan Richards and Antonio Reynoso, urged the city to extend the beach season, increase lifeguard shifts, and offer universal swimming lessons. The city has only 870 lifeguards, far short of the 1,500 needed. Vulnerable swimmers remain at risk while officials debate.

Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis.

The measure covers just 0.13% of city streets, possibly reaching 0.8% if regional slow zones expand. The first such zone will be south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan. DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow.
