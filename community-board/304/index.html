Twelve seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, traffic violence in Brooklyn CB4 has not let up. The numbers are blunt: 1,047 crashes, 560 injured, 5 killed. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars that do not fade. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just days ago, a 47-year-old man tried to cross Broadway at Suydam Street. He did not make it. The driver kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene.&rdquo;</a> His name is not yet public. His absence is.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-break>Patterns That Do Not Break</h3><p>The violence is not random. It is a pattern. In the last twelve months, young adults aged 25–34 have been hit hardest: 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, 193 injured. Children and elders are not spared. Cars, trucks, and vans do most of the damage. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who did not come home.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-silences>Leadership: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Julia Salazar <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on a bill</a> to curb repeat speeders, aiming to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. Assembly Member Maritza Davila <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the same bill</a>. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not. The council can demand more. It has not.</p><p>The silence is loud. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another risk. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streetsblog NYC reports: 'renewing calls from advocates for the city to redesign the dangerous street.' Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, State Sen. Julia Salazar, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher back the push. Advocates want a protected bike lane, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. Despite meetings and official letters, the city has not acted. The safety analyst notes: advocacy alone brings no immediate safety change, but it could spark future improvements.

The move follows a court ruling allowing the change. City Hall claims the redesign addresses 'serious safety concerns.' Legal precedent (Turturro v.
