A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.

The matter, titled 'expanding the delivery worker minimum wage to grocery delivery workers,' drew sharp lines. Council Member Sandy Nurse (D-Brooklyn), sponsor, blasted industry claims that fair pay would hurt food-insecure New Yorkers, calling them 'absurd and thoughtless.' The Chamber of Progress, representing Instacart and others, testified against the bills. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) and advocacy groups testified in favor, with Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga stating, 'This package of bills would close that gap.' Economic experts argued that previous wage hikes did not raise prices for consumers. Advocates for immigrant and Muslim workers demanded equal wage protections.
