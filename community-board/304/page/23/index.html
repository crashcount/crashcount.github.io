A car hits him. He flies ten feet, lands hard, and the driver vanishes. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes in the hospital with a broken ankle, a fractured skull, and a pelvis split open. He says, &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died on Brooklyn CB4 streets. Ten more were seriously injured. Four hundred forty-seven were hurt. The dead include a 59-year-old man, struck while crossing with the signal. A 26-year-old cyclist, crushed by a car. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement, titled 'What the Livable Streets Movement Wants from Thursday’s State of the City Address,' urges the city to prioritize open streets, permanent outdoor dining, and public transit. The group calls for eliminating parking mandates and expanding Summer Streets to Brooklyn and Queens. They demand automated curb enforcement and a reduction in the city’s vehicle fleet. Borough Presidents Antonio Reynoso and Donovan Richards support the Summer Streets expansion. The statement insists, 'Leadership should be celebrating [public transit] and investing in it above all else.' The advocates reject half-measures and marketing campaigns.

This would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter, titled 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass...S.315/A.1416, which would authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program,' was sponsored by Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Amanda Farías, Julie Won, Carlina Rivera, and Crystal Hudson. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The measure aimed to protect pedestrians and cyclists by slowing traffic where people gather. But with the bill stalled, Open Streets remain at risk from fast-moving vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation cited federal and state rules for the widening. The plan, discussed in a public meeting, drew sharp criticism. The matter summary reads: 'proposing three similar options for a redesign that will restore three lanes of traffic in each direction, with a park on top.' Liz Denys of Bridges 4 People called out the city for ignoring creative ideas and failing to reduce car and truck traffic. William Meehan criticized the focus on beautification over safety. Council Member Lincoln Restler urged a reduction in car impacts, while Borough President Antonio Reynoso condemned the neglect of environmental justice.

He wants car-free streets in Brooklyn, longer than Manhattan’s. He pledges funding. He rejects short, patchwork routes. The city drags its feet. Pedestrians and cyclists wait for safe, open roads.</p><p class=mb3>On November 29, 2022, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called on the Department of Transportation to expand the Summer Streets program into Brooklyn. Reynoso insists the new corridor must be at least as long as Manhattan’s six-and-a-half-mile stretch, not just a patchwork of short Open Streets. He told Streetsblog, "We have to think about, long-term, having a route that is as long if not longer than the one Manhattan does." Reynoso commits city funding to make this happen. The Adams administration has yet to announce plans. The matter, described as 'expansion of car-free Summer Streets program to Brooklyn,' remains in policy advocacy, with support from public-space advocates. Reynoso’s push centers on opening streets to pedestrians and cyclists, not just for events, but as a lasting, borough-wide change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
