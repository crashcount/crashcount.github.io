Twelve seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, traffic violence in Brooklyn CB4 has not let up. The numbers are blunt: 1,047 crashes, 560 injured, 5 killed. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars that do not fade. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just days ago, a 47-year-old man tried to cross Broadway at Suydam Street. He did not make it. The driver kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene.&rdquo;</a> His name is not yet public. His absence is.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-break>Patterns That Do Not Break</h3><p>The violence is not random. It is a pattern. In the last twelve months, young adults aged 25–34 have been hit hardest: 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, 193 injured. Children and elders are not spared. Cars, trucks, and vans do most of the damage. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who did not come home.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-silences>Leadership: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Julia Salazar <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on a bill</a> to curb repeat speeders, aiming to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. Assembly Member Maritza Davila <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the same bill</a>. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not. The council can demand more. It has not.</p><p>The silence is loud. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another risk. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The original lane reduction and protected bike lane plan, previously scrapped, will now move forward for the southern half of the street, between Calyer Street and Meeker Avenue. The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and other local officials celebrated the move, crediting the Make McGuinness Safe coalition for relentless pressure. Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.' The northern half of the boulevard remains unchanged, with two traffic lanes and barrier-protected bike lanes.

The motorcycle and a northbound sedan collided, though neither vehicle sustained damage. The rider, wearing a helmet, suffered contusions across her entire body but was conscious and not ejected. The report cites 'View Obstructed/Limited' as the primary contributing factor for both vehicles, indicating that limited visibility played a critical role in the crash. There is no mention of pedestrian involvement or victim fault.

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, a group of New York State legislators—Assembly Members Phil Steck and Andrew Hevesi, State Senator Julia Salazar, and former Assembly Member Dick Gottfried—filed a legal brief against Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing. The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
