A car hits him. He flies ten feet, lands hard, and the driver vanishes. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes in the hospital with a broken ankle, a fractured skull, and a pelvis split open. He says, &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died on Brooklyn CB4 streets. Ten more were seriously injured. Four hundred forty-seven were hurt. The dead include a 59-year-old man, struck while crossing with the signal. A 26-year-old cyclist, crushed by a car. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill required 'taxis and for-hire vehicles to display a decal warning passengers to look for cyclists when opening the door.' Council Members Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor, District 33) and Jennifer Gutiérrez (co-sponsor, District 34) led the push. The Taxi and Limousine Commission would have provided the decals at no cost. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to cut down on dooring crashes—sudden, violent, and often deadly for cyclists. The risk persists.

Their letter called for a transformation of the avenue, described as "one of the most dangerous and non-inclusive roadways in the entire city." The officials urged DOT to prioritize traffic safety, cycling and mass transit infrastructure, pedestrian walkability, and green space. Between January 2022 and December 2023, Conduit Avenue saw 1,321 crashes, injuring 880 people—including 70 pedestrians and 14 cyclists—and killing five. Three intersections are listed as DOT pedestrian safety priorities, but the corridor itself is not. Richards and Reynoso have formed a task force and are pushing for action.

The DOT’s first plan would have cut traffic lanes and added a parking-protected bike lane. Adams ordered a weaker version after business pushback. The compromise left two car lanes in each direction during the day. Elected officials—U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and Council Member Lincoln Restler—sent a letter urging DOT to restore the full safety plan, writing, “Nothing has been done to improve conditions for pedestrians.” Advocates say the new design increases crossing distances and leaves cyclists and pedestrians exposed. DOT says work will continue into 2024. The boulevard remains dangerous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Trucks flood neighborhoods, endanger lives, and choke streets. Introduction 708 demands safer, smarter routes. The bill has strong support. The city’s map has not changed since the 1970s.</p><p class=mb3>Introduction 708, sponsored by Council Member Alexa Avilés, seeks a sweeping overhaul of New York City’s outdated truck route map. The bill, now before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was highlighted in an op-ed published November 13, 2023. Avilés, as committee chair, wrote, 'An overhaul of our truck route map is long overdue. We must pass Introduction 708 for the sake of our communities and all New Yorkers.' The measure would require the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to improve safety, visibility, and reduce congestion and emissions. It also mandates input from neighborhoods, environmental groups, and industry. Avilés leads a coalition of 40 co-sponsors, with support from Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The bill responds to the surge in freight traffic, which has battered streets and put vulnerable communities—often communities of color—at risk. The current map, unchanged since the 1970s, routes heavy trucks through residential areas, increasing danger for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No new public money. Electrification pilot starts. Advocates slam lack of expansion. Riders outside core zones stay shut out. System grows in power, not reach.</p><p class=mb3>On November 6, 2023, the Adams Administration and Lyft announced amendments to the Citi Bike contract, which runs through 2029. The deal, covered in Streetsblog NYC, doubles e-bikes from 10,000 to 20,000 and adds new and replacement classic bikes. The matter summary states, 'No system expansion... you're not going to be able to ride the bikes anywhere new because system expansion was not part of the amendment agreement.' Council members were not directly named, but Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso praised electrification, saying, 'This is exactly the direction we should be moving in—toward greener, safer, and more accessible micromobility options for New Yorkers.' John Tomac of Bike South Brooklyn condemned the lack of expansion: 'We're disappointed that you still can’t ride a Citi Bike in most of New York City.' The contract introduces price caps but avoids public funding. The city’s refusal to expand or subsidize Citi Bike leaves many vulnerable road users in transit deserts, with safer, greener options still out of reach.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
