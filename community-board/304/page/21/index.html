A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Residents breathe exhaust.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2023, Council Member Alexa Avilés (District 38) led a legislative push to regulate last-mile warehouses. The bill, now before the council, seeks to amend zoning laws to require special permits for new facilities. The measure aims to stop warehouse clustering near schools, parks, and homes, and mandates studies on truck traffic and air quality. The proposal, described as a response to 'an epidemic of truck traffic,' targets companies like Amazon whose rapid delivery model floods streets with trucks. Avilés declared, 'This is environmental racism. Last-mile facilities follow the same pattern, dumping environmental burdens on low-income communities of color.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez joined, demanding companies 'be responsible, take our communities into account so that we can breathe cleaner air.' The Adams administration expressed concern about economic impacts but supports electrification and cargo bike incentives. The bill awaits committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nurse pushes for quarterly meetings with city officials, industry, and labor until the program launches. Mayor Adams and Sanitation Commissioner Tisch have delayed the law, citing cost concerns. Nurse insists, 'We are not going backwards. This is something that needs to happen.' The City Council will hold a hearing.

Key staff quit. Only half the jobs are filled. Streets stay dangerous. Trucks keep rolling. Council members and advocates demand action. The city drags its feet. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Local Law 199 of 2019, meant to create 20 commercial waste zones and cut deadly truck traffic, faces delays under the Adams administration. The Department of Sanitation claims it needs more time to avoid mistakes and cost spikes. Council Member Antonio Reynoso questioned, 'Covid was the original reason why we had to postpone, but now the city is operating in full, why continue with delays on the implementation?' Justin Wood, an advocate, warned, 'Yet another tragic fatality involving a private sanitation truck shows the urgent need to fully implement the new commercial waste zones system.' Staff departures and unfilled positions cripple progress. Council Member Sandy Nurse lamented the loss of key leadership. The city says it remains committed, but the streets tell another story. A Council hearing is set to address the ongoing risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
