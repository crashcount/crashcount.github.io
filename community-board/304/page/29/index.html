A car hits him. He flies ten feet, lands hard, and the driver vanishes. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes in the hospital with a broken ankle, a fractured skull, and a pelvis split open. He says, &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died on Brooklyn CB4 streets. Ten more were seriously injured. Four hundred forty-seven were hurt. The dead include a 59-year-old man, struck while crossing with the signal. A 26-year-old cyclist, crushed by a car. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measures, revived in committee, seek to redesign truck routes and gather data on facilities run by Amazon, FedEx, and UPS. The matter aims to 'reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety and increase visibility,' especially in overburdened neighborhoods like Red Hook and Sunset Park. Avilés, the lead sponsor, calls for systematic changes: 'We really need to look systematically at more improved routes to ensure people are safe.' The bills would require the Department of Transportation to daylight intersections and the Department of Environmental Protection to install air monitors on heavy-use roads. Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsors a related bill for public truck-route data. The legislation draws support from industry and advocates, all seeking safer streets and cleaner air for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event came as the public comment period for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Central Business District Tolling Program ended. The plan would toll drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, aiming to cut traffic and pollution. Restler said, “This is a tangible, major, sweeping policy that will dramatically reduce the number of cars and trucks on the street in New York City.” He supported limited exemptions, especially for taxis and for-hire vehicles, but stressed the need to keep cars off the road. The rally urged the Federal Highway Administration to approve the plan, which is expected to shift commuters to mass transit and modernize city infrastructure. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon also backed a taxi carveout.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Wright said, 'Congestion pricing will have benefits for communities across the city and region: It will reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. It will raise vital revenue for public transit. It will make the transportation system more equitable.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler planned a rally in support. The statement acknowledged minor impacts, like increased traffic on select highways, but insisted these can be addressed by electrifying fleets and capping highways.

They wrote to Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, stating, 'Every year, we see how much New Yorkers enjoy the car-free street and associated activities, and we are writing to ask you to bring this beloved event to our respective boroughs in 2023.' The Department of Transportation said it would review the request. Advocates like Juan Restrepo and Jackson Chabot joined the call, demanding more hours and borough-wide access. Community groups stressed the benefits for families and children. The program is described as cost-effective, crime-free, and vital for community building.

The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the Assembly as of August 30, 2022. The measure, led by State Senator Julia Salazar and Assembly Member Robert Carroll, aims to make e-bikes accessible to working-class New Yorkers. Salazar says, 'With the Ride Clean rebate, [e-bikes] really would be much more accessible to working New Yorkers.' Carroll pushes back on critics who call e-bikes a luxury, stating, 'They don’t realize that this is not a luxury item.' The program would use NYSERDA funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, mirroring the Drive Clean program for electric cars. Advocates cite European and U.S. models. The bill’s fate now rests with the Assembly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
