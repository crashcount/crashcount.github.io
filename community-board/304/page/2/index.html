A car hits him. He flies ten feet, lands hard, and the driver vanishes. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes in the hospital with a broken ankle, a fractured skull, and a pelvis split open. He says, &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died on Brooklyn CB4 streets. Ten more were seriously injured. Four hundred forty-seven were hurt. The dead include a 59-year-old man, struck while crossing with the signal. A 26-year-old cyclist, crushed by a car. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The mayor claims the rollback is due to 'safety concerns.' The article notes, 'The decision to remove it is drawing mixed reaction in Williamsburg.' No details are given on specific incidents or data prompting the change. The removal eliminates a key barrier between cyclists and traffic. This action raises questions about city policy and the commitment to protecting vulnerable road users.

Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
