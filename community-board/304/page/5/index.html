Nine left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last year, 443 people were hurt on these streets. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. A man in his twenties, a woman in her sixties, a child—none are spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He was a passenger, not the driver. He sent a text to his best friend that night: <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having such a good time, and I met some new people.&rdquo;</em> He never made it home. The driver who killed him ran. His aunt <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>remembered</a>, <em>&ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Ruari Fay-Handebeaux stood in a crosswalk. A car hit him and launched him into the intersection. His body broke in many places. <em>&ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull,&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>he said</a>. His father was killed by a driver too.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h2><p><strong>851 crashes in a year.</strong> The blood does not dry. The next crash is already coming. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are safe. Vans, trucks, SUVs, sedans, mopeds: all have left bodies behind. The intersection at Wyckoff and Himrod is unchanged. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Waiting</h2><p>Local leaders have the power. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Speed cameras work, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The city asks Albany for more authority. The clock ticks. The dead wait for nothing.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the return of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Demand speed cameras stay on.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. Do not wait for another name to join the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 20-year-old male bicyclist was riding eastbound when a 2018 Honda SUV, also traveling east, was entering a parked position. The SUV struck the bicyclist on its left front quarter panel, causing the bicyclist to be ejected and sustain head injuries. The bicyclist was reported in shock and complained of pain or nausea. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors on the part of the SUV driver. The bicyclist was wearing a harness but no other victim behaviors were listed as contributing factors.
