A car hits him. He flies ten feet, lands hard, and the driver vanishes. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes in the hospital with a broken ankle, a fractured skull, and a pelvis split open. He says, &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died on Brooklyn CB4 streets. Ten more were seriously injured. Four hundred forty-seven were hurt. The dead include a 59-year-old man, struck while crossing with the signal. A 26-year-old cyclist, crushed by a car. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) announced on January 31, 2024, that only one of twenty zones—Jackson Heights, Corona, Elmhurst—will launch this year. The law aims to cut truck miles in half, add backup cameras, GPS, and safety training. DSNY spokesperson Joshua Goodman said contracts target safety and worker protections. Reynoso urged ongoing oversight, saying, 'It is important that DSNY continuously reassess implementation and course correct as needed.' Yet, delays persist, especially on installing guard rails to prevent pedestrians and cyclists from being swept under trucks. Justin Wood of NYLPI voiced concern over the slow rollout. The program promises fewer trucks and safer streets, but for now, most neighborhoods wait.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes.

The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes.
