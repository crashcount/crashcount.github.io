A car hits him. He flies ten feet, lands hard, and the driver vanishes. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes in the hospital with a broken ankle, a fractured skull, and a pelvis split open. He says, &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died on Brooklyn CB4 streets. Ten more were seriously injured. Four hundred forty-seven were hurt. The dead include a 59-year-old man, struck while crossing with the signal. A 26-year-old cyclist, crushed by a car. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident highlights ongoing failures in city safety policy. The intersection is described as 'very dangerous,' with fast turns and drivers not yielding. Only 27 percent of the city’s 5,860 heavy garbage trucks have side guards, despite a 2019 city deal requiring them by 2024. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, then a Council Member, said, 'side rails should be installed sooner.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives called for 'bold action' and criticized city officials for delaying redesigns and safety steps. The private carting industry remains under scrutiny after repeated fatal crashes. No council bill number is attached, but the event underscores the urgent need for systemic change to protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill requires the NYC Department of Transportation to give extra notifications and presentations to community boards and local officials before installing or removing bike lanes or racks. The matter summary reads: 'require the NYC DOT to provide additional notifications and presentations.' Advocacy groups, including Bike New York, are preparing testimony to stall the bill before it reaches the Senate floor or Assembly Cities Committee. Critics argue the DOT already must notify community boards under the 'Fidler rule,' and that this bill would gum up the process, delaying life-saving bike infrastructure. A legislative source called the bill 'boneheaded.' Public polls show strong support for more bike lanes, with only a small minority opposed.

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, titled 'Borough beeps join city transit advocates for better bus service,' spotlighted stalled promises and called for Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul to deliver. Restler and others backed the Bus Turnaround Coalition’s push for network redesigns, expanded and more frequent service, all-door boarding, and tougher enforcement in bus lanes. Comptroller Brad Lander stressed that 'expanded bus routes must also match 21st century travel patterns.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso linked better buses to less car dependence and climate action. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged 150 new miles of busways and lanes. The campaign aims to speed up buses, cut car dominance, and put vulnerable road users first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists’ voices count.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2022, New York State launched the first New York Bike Census, a voluntary survey led by NYSERDA and Urban Cycling Solutions. The effort is described as 'an unprecedented effort to collect detailed data on bicycle transportation across the state.' The survey asks about riding frequency, infrastructure, barriers, and connections to transit. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and State Senator Julia Salazar have backed related legislation for an e-bike rebate program. The survey’s results will be shared with governments and advocacy groups. Officials say the data will help planners and policymakers 'invest in safer, more equitable multimodal streets.' No direct safety impact assessment was provided, but the project aims to inform future improvements for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
