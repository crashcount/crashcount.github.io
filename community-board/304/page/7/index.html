Twelve seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, traffic violence in Brooklyn CB4 has not let up. The numbers are blunt: 1,047 crashes, 560 injured, 5 killed. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars that do not fade. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just days ago, a 47-year-old man tried to cross Broadway at Suydam Street. He did not make it. The driver kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene.&rdquo;</a> His name is not yet public. His absence is.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-break>Patterns That Do Not Break</h3><p>The violence is not random. It is a pattern. In the last twelve months, young adults aged 25–34 have been hit hardest: 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, 193 injured. Children and elders are not spared. Cars, trucks, and vans do most of the damage. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who did not come home.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-silences>Leadership: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Julia Salazar <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on a bill</a> to curb repeat speeders, aiming to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. Assembly Member Maritza Davila <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the same bill</a>. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not. The council can demand more. It has not.</p><p>The silence is loud. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another risk. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Yarimi, driving with a suspended license, allegedly sped through a red light at 68 mph in a 25-mph zone, striking the family as they crossed Ocean Parkway. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst' crashes in his career, stating, 'This defendant's unconscionably dangerous driving wiped out a family.' The crash also injured Saada's young son and five Uber passengers. Yarimi faces multiple felony charges and up to 15 years in prison. The case highlights the deadly risk of high-speed driving and license violations on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT delays a promised bike lane. Elected officials and residents demand action. Private interests block progress. Cyclists face crashes and fear. The city shrugs. The gap remains. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, a coalition of Brooklyn officials—including Council Members Crystal Hudson, Shahana Hanif, Lincoln Restler, Assembly Members Andrew Gounardes, Jo Anne Simon, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso—sent a letter urging DOT to finish the protected bike lane on Ashland Place. The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ocean Parkway became a scene of sudden loss.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on March 29, 2025, that a crash on Ocean Parkway killed a mother and her two daughters, ages 5 and 8, while her 4-year-old son was left in critical condition. Police say a Toyota Camry, turning right, was rear-ended by an Audi sedan. The impact pushed the Camry aside, and the Audi continued forward, striking the family in a crosswalk before overturning. The Audi's driver, Miriam Yarimi, 32, was arrested and charged with manslaughter. Police said she was driving on a suspended license. Investigators are examining whether she ran a red light or was speeding. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' The incident highlights ongoing risks for pedestrians and questions about enforcement of license suspensions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 28, 2025, the City Council’s Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises held a hearing on the future of Atlantic Avenue. The Department of Transportation (DOT) declined to commit to a full redesign of a deadly 13-block stretch, despite pressure from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé. Both made redesign a condition for supporting a major rezoning. The official matter: 'The administration must commit to a fully-funded redesign of Atlantic Avenue from Flatbush Avenue in the west to Nostrand Avenue in the east.' DOT’s Brooklyn Borough Planner, Dash Henley, promised only an 18-month traffic study and minor intersection tweaks, projecting a seven-to-ten-year wait for real change. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso joined calls for traffic calming and lane reallocation. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured here. Advocates and council members want protected bike lanes and road diets.
