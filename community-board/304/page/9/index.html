Twelve seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, traffic violence in Brooklyn CB4 has not let up. The numbers are blunt: 1,047 crashes, 560 injured, 5 killed. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars that do not fade. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just days ago, a 47-year-old man tried to cross Broadway at Suydam Street. He did not make it. The driver kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene.&rdquo;</a> His name is not yet public. His absence is.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-break>Patterns That Do Not Break</h3><p>The violence is not random. It is a pattern. In the last twelve months, young adults aged 25–34 have been hit hardest: 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, 193 injured. Children and elders are not spared. Cars, trucks, and vans do most of the damage. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who did not come home.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-silences>Leadership: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Julia Salazar <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on a bill</a> to curb repeat speeders, aiming to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. Assembly Member Maritza Davila <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the same bill</a>. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not. The council can demand more. It has not.</p><p>The silence is loud. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another risk. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The board demanded more parking, ignoring transit and non-drivers. Council Member Vernikov opposed the project. More parking means more cars, more danger for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On February 18, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 15 rejected a rezoning proposal at 2510 Coney Island Ave. The board’s vote came after the developer slashed housing units and promised a one-to-one parking ratio. The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers. The City Council is expected to reject the project, blocking new homes and locking in car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) would not commit to a 'road diet' or redesign for the deadly 13-block Brooklyn stretch, pending a traffic study that could take two years and requires Council funding. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé, along with Borough President Antonio Reynoso, demanded a fully funded redesign, calling Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough.' Residents testified about fear and danger from speeding cars and blind turns. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured in 831 crashes. Advocates and lawmakers condemned DOT's reluctance, calling it emblematic of citywide failures. The rezoning plan, which could add thousands of residents, now moves to the full Council.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He calls for a road diet, better bike and pedestrian infrastructure, and metered parking. DOT offers piecemeal fixes, but no bold redesign. Advocates want more.</p><p class=mb3>On January 29, 2025, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso pressed the Department of Transportation to overhaul a six-lane stretch of Atlantic Avenue as part of a rezoning plan. Reynoso’s recommendations—outlined in his official statement—include a road diet, pedestrian and cyclist upgrades, and paid parking. He criticized DOT’s lack of detail, saying, 'Daylighting streets is necessary, but a bare minimum.' The Atlantic Avenue Mixed Use Plan, now heading to a Department of City Planning hearing, would rezone 13 blocks and remove parking minimums for new housing. Council Member Crystal Hudson acknowledged the community’s demand for safety but stopped short of backing a road diet. DOT has promised some safety tweaks—painted neckdowns, daylighting, planters, a new bike lane—but not a full redesign. Advocates and Transportation Alternatives call for protected bike lanes and pedestrian plazas. Reynoso’s push highlights the gap between incremental fixes and the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the NYPD, 'a man driving a cargo van struck both of them while making a left turn.' Gil died from her injuries; her aide was hospitalized. Police did not arrest or charge the driver. The article notes that Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year, and cites Transportation Alternatives: '46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year.' The crash highlights the ongoing risk seniors face on city streets, especially at intersections where turning vehicles endanger those crossing on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety bills stalled. Parking won. Cyclists and pedestrians lost. Deaths stayed high. Advocates condemned the shift. The Speaker and committee heads blocked reforms. Vulnerable New Yorkers paid the price.</p><p class=mb3>""[Intro 606] that was brought forth by Bob Holden wouldn't have seen the light of day and wouldn't have gotten as many signatures as it has now because the leadership wouldn't have had it that way. We wouldn't allow for what I consider his false narrative and public perception to dictate safety and safety policy."" -- Antonio Reynoso</p><p class=mb3>On January 21, 2025, the City Council, under Speaker Adrienne Adams, set its transportation agenda. The session saw progressives sidelined as the Council prioritized car-centric bills, including Intros 103 and 104 (parking protection) and hearings on Intro 606 (e-bike registration). The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety. The Council's actions marked a retreat from previous street safety gains, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact hit the vehicle’s left front bumper, leaving the child injured but conscious.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2021 Toyota SUV traveling southeast on Myrtle Avenue struck an 11-year-old pedestrian crossing outside a crosswalk. The vehicle's left front bumper was the point of impact. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, classified as injury severity level 3, but remained conscious. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. The pedestrian was crossing without a signal, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor. The driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred. This incident highlights the dangers posed by distracted driving on city streets, especially to vulnerable pedestrians outside designated crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
