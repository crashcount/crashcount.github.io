A car hits him. He flies ten feet, lands hard, and the driver vanishes. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes in the hospital with a broken ankle, a fractured skull, and a pelvis split open. He says, &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died on Brooklyn CB4 streets. Ten more were seriously injured. Four hundred forty-seven were hurt. The dead include a 59-year-old man, struck while crossing with the signal. A 26-year-old cyclist, crushed by a car. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>).

They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first.

She suffered fatal crush wounds and never regained consciousness. A second pedestrian, age 44, was also hit and sustained chest contusions but remained conscious. The report states the Mazda driver was unlicensed and disregarded traffic control. 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' are listed as contributing factors. The victims were crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as documented in the report.

The rule targets companies with deadly records. Data will track harm, expose danger, and force accountability. Streets and lives hang in the balance. The city must act.</p><p class=mb3>On May 7, 2024, the Department of Sanitation proposed amendments to the Commercial Waste Zones program. The rule, not yet law, would require all contracted waste haulers to submit detailed crash and driving data twice a year. The matter targets companies like Action Carting, linked to at least five traffic deaths. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who led the original reforms as a council member, said, 'Crash data from [commercial waste zone] awardees is good, but crash data from CWZ applicants would have been even better.' The bill aims to end the 'Wild West' of private waste hauling, which killed seven New Yorkers in a single year. The new rules demand real-time telematics, immediate injury reports, and full transparency on crashes. Advocates say the data could help redesign streets and hold dangerous drivers to account.

Only one Queens zone launches this fall. Nineteen more wait in limbo. Oversight is absent. Haulers with deadly records win contracts. Advocates demand speed, transparency, and real safety for streets choked by trucks.</p><p class=mb3>Council Bill for commercial waste zone reform, passed in 2019, remains stalled. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch only one zone in central Queens after September 3, 2024. The oversight task force has not met in two years. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who authored the law as a Council member, called DSNY’s rollout a 'missed opportunity' for clarity and accountability. Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.' The city’s goal to cut truck miles falls short of original promises. Action Carting, whose driver killed a cyclist in 2017, secured contracts for 14 zones. Advocates say the lack of outreach, oversight, and clear safety benchmarks leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced March 19, 2024, the bill would require the Department of Transportation to paint and install overhead school safety signs on every street with a school entrance. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing safety signs near schools.' Council Member Susan Zhuang leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Gennaro, Won, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Louis, Cabán, Restler, Farías, Banks, and Riley as co-sponsors. The bill aims to alert drivers to the presence of school-aged children and pedestrians. It remains in committee, with no vote or enactment date set. The measure targets a simple truth: children cross streets, drivers often do not see them. Signs alone will not stop cars, but they mark danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
