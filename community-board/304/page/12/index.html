Twelve seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, traffic violence in Brooklyn CB4 has not let up. The numbers are blunt: 1,047 crashes, 560 injured, 5 killed. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars that do not fade. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just days ago, a 47-year-old man tried to cross Broadway at Suydam Street. He did not make it. The driver kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene.&rdquo;</a> His name is not yet public. His absence is.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-break>Patterns That Do Not Break</h3><p>The violence is not random. It is a pattern. In the last twelve months, young adults aged 25–34 have been hit hardest: 2 killed, 6 seriously hurt, 193 injured. Children and elders are not spared. Cars, trucks, and vans do most of the damage. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who did not come home.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-silences>Leadership: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Some leaders have moved. State Senator Julia Salazar <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on a bill</a> to curb repeat speeders, aiming to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. Assembly Member Maritza Davila <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored the same bill</a>. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not. The council can demand more. It has not.</p><p>The silence is loud. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another risk. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Parking mandates stay in low-density zones. Central areas lose mandates. Housing projections drop. Some neighborhoods bear the burden. Car-centric rules persist. Vulnerable road users see little relief. The city’s streets remain dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>""The consequences of today's decision to exempt R1, R2, and R3 contextual districts from City of Yes are severe," he said in a statement. "The housing pressure on every other neighborhood will go up, which means if Queens or Staten Island doesn't grow, Brooklyn is asked to do more than our fair share."" -- Antonio Reynoso</p><p class=mb3>Bill: City of Yes zoning reform. Status: Amended and advanced by City Council on November 22, 2024. The Council’s action, described as 'watering down' the mayor’s plan, keeps mandatory parking in low-density neighborhoods while ending it in central areas. The matter summary states: 'ending mandatory parking in areas with the best transit while keeping the costly mandate in low-density neighborhoods where it most hinders development.' Council Member Crystal Hudson voted yes, urging all neighborhoods to share the housing burden. Council Member Kevin Riley defended single-family zones. Council Member Rafael Salamanca cited balancing concerns and securing $5 billion for affordable housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso warned of increased housing pressure elsewhere. The Council’s changes preserve car-centric zoning, leaving vulnerable road users exposed and limiting progress on safer, less car-dependent streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

As of October 30, 2024, only one zone is active. No timeline exists for citywide rollout. The Department of Sanitation claims caution is needed to avoid price hikes and ensure effective change, but offers no clear metrics or deadlines. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, pleads, 'We can't wait another day to enforce truck safety requirements.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso warns, 'The city's goal right now should be to prevent bad implementation from undermining a good bill.' Delays keep streets deadly for workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The law’s promise remains unfulfilled.
