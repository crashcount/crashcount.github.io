A car hits him. He flies ten feet, lands hard, and the driver vanishes. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes in the hospital with a broken ankle, a fractured skull, and a pelvis split open. He says, &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people died on Brooklyn CB4 streets. Ten more were seriously injured. Four hundred forty-seven were hurt. The dead include a 59-year-old man, struck while crossing with the signal. A 26-year-old cyclist, crushed by a car. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and killed. The numbers do not slow. Eight deaths, eighteen serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-repeated-loss>Repeat Offenders, Repeated Loss</h3><p>Hayden Wallace was 29. He died in a Bushwick hit-and-run. The man charged with killing him had fled crashes before. Hayden’s aunt said, &ldquo;He lived life to the fullest. He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered. He was loved by so many&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/28/man-arrested-killing-recent-brooklyn-transplant-2024-hit-run/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The driver was out on bail for another crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/08/brooklyn-man-nabbed-in-fatal-hit-and-run-was-free-on-bail-for-fleeing-earlier-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran again. The law let him back behind the wheel. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They cite new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets in Bushwick do not change fast. The intersection where Ruari was hit is still the same. The law that could lower speeds to 20 mph sits unused. The camera program faces expiration. No new protections for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every death, every broken body, is preventable. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, organized by Vision Zero opponents, was set to criticize the city's road safety program. But after a tow truck driver killed 7-year-old Kamei Hughes near Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Crystal Hudson withdrew. In their open letter, they wrote, 'Holding a forum where Vision Zero will be criticized in the neighborhood next to where a young boy’s life was lost to traffic violence sends the wrong message to the community and to our borough.' The church, led by Rev. Anthony Trufant, canceled the meeting. Local residents called for more enforcement against reckless drivers. The tragedy underscored the stakes: pedestrian deaths are down, but the toll of traffic violence remains high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, as reported, centers on public frustration: 'Adams had previously promised to do "whatever it takes to keep our streets safe" after the child’s death.' Council Member Crystal Hudson and Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for urgent safety improvements. A Brooklyn parent’s letter demanding action drew 1,800 signatures in days.

The crash happened near Fort Greene Park, where witnesses reported the driver was speeding, using her phone, and dragged the child before stopping. The intersection’s visibility was blocked by a legally parked car, as New York City exempts itself from state daylighting rules. Council Member Crystal Hudson visited the scene, spoke with police and residents, and acknowledged a pattern of reckless tow truck driving. Hudson said, 'This is the worst possible outcome, and, yet, we are forced to reckon with the worst possible outcome at the hands of the NYPD all too often.' Residents demanded speed bumps and crossing guards. The crash came as the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and crossing guard positions were cut. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for an end to 'senseless traffic violence.' The district has a high rate of crashes and a history of resistance to safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Eighty-eight crashes scar the street. Safety took a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On October 13, 2023, local officials and advocates criticized Mayor Adams for halting the Ashland Place redesign. The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the posting of signs notifying operators of bicycles, bicycles with electric assist, and electric scooters of the prohibition against operating such devices on sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, and of related fines and penalties," would require the Department of Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation to post signs warning riders of these restrictions and the consequences. Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Hanif, Brewer, Ung, Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Gutiérrez, and Schulman. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No direct safety analysis was provided. The measure aims for clarity, not infrastructure change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
