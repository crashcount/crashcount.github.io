Fourteen people have died since 2022. Forty-nine more have been seriously injured. The numbers do not flinch. They do not blink. They do not bring anyone back.</p><p>A man tries to cross East 149th and Morris. A van turns left. The man, Inza Fofana, 52, is struck. He dies at Lincoln Hospital. The driver stays. No arrest.

These are the weapons. Cars and trucks killed or seriously injured 103 people walking in Bronx CB1 since 2022. Motorcycles and mopeds: 4. Bikes: 3. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is heavier, who is faster, who is left standing.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The city says it will make the streets safe. The city says, &ldquo;Every New Yorker deserves safe streets.&rdquo; But the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise. The laws come slow. The changes come slower. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. Speed limits drop, but only on some streets. The rest wait.</p><p>No one has been charged in the latest deaths. No one has been held to account.</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-yours>The Next Move Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
