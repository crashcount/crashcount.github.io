Since 2022, Bronx CB1 logged <strong>15 deaths</strong> and <strong>2,387 injuries</strong> across <strong>3,763 crashes</strong>. The toll skews to people outside cars: six pedestrians and three cyclists dead. The count is from city data.</p><h3 id=east-149th-the-line-that-keeps-breaking>East 149th: the line that keeps breaking</h3><p>A taxi going east on East 149th struck a man late at night. He never woke up, the city file says <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>June 25, 2024</a>. Three months later, a 52‑year‑old man died near E 149 St and Morris Ave in a chain of SUVs in the afternoon, also on <strong>E 149 St</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>April 2, 2025</a>. A cyclist riding east at Brook Ave was hit by a left‑turning MTA bus and killed at night on <strong>E 149 St</strong> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Feb. 25, 2025</a>.</p><p>The city’s hotspot list puts <strong>East 149 Street</strong> among the worst in CB1. So is <strong>Bruckner Blvd</strong> and the <strong>Bruckner Expressway</strong>—corridors built for speed, not people <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data top intersections</a>.</p><h3 id=when-the-clock-turns-the-bodies-rise>When the clock turns, the bodies rise</h3><p>The hours tell a pattern. Injuries climb after dark. From 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., injuries stay high, with a spike at 8 p.m. and a grim rise in deaths at 9–11 p.m. and again at 1–2 a.m. In this board, nights cut deep: deaths stack at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 9–11 p.m., and 7 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><h3 id=trucks-buses-taxis--heavy-metal-heavy-harm>Trucks, buses, taxis — heavy metal, heavy harm</h3><p>Pedestrians here are most often struck by SUVs and sedans. But <strong>trucks and buses</strong> are in the mix and deadly: trucks/buses caused a share of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries, including the bus that killed a cyclist on E 149 St at Brook Ave <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup; crash 4795059</a>. Bruckner is a truck route. The bodies are local.</p><h3 id=whats-causing-it>What’s causing it</h3><p>The city tags “other” as the lead factor category for deaths and injuries in CB1. After that, errors by people outside cars show up. Distraction appears. Red‑light running shows in fatal records too <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors</a>.</p><h3 id=two-minutes-on-bruckner-a-life-gone>Two minutes on Bruckner, a life gone</h3><p>A moped and a tanker truck met at Bruckner Blvd and Southern Blvd just after 7 a.m. A 22‑year‑old passenger died. The record notes a left turn and a traffic control disregarded <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>June 13, 2025</a>.</p><h3 id=the-parkway-teaches-the-same-lesson>The parkway teaches the same lesson</h3><p>Outside the board, the Bronx River Parkway showed what speed and passing do to flesh. A 21‑year‑old driver was charged after two riders died. One sister said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“Two people were killed.

The mother asked, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“How could they let him go?”</a></p><h3 id=what-to-fix-now-on-our-blocks>What to fix now on our blocks</h3><ul><li>Daylight the crossings on East 149th and along Bruckner. Hard posts. No curbside parking at corners. Left turns need steel, not paint.</li><li>Left‑turn signals and hardened turns at E 149 St and Brook Ave, Morris Ave, and other repeat corners.

The Council and mayor can set safer limits. <strong>Lower the default speed</strong>. The city has the power, advocates say. Then go after the worst repeat offenders. A tiny slice of drivers do outsized harm. As one analysis put it, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>“1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths,” and 30+ camera tickets multiplies the risk fifty‑fold</a>. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045/A2299)</strong> would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers with repeat points or tickets. State Sen. Jose Serrano backed it in committee <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Assembly Member Amanda Septimo co‑sponsors the Assembly version <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>.</p><p>One more thing. The city’s own numbers show nights here are deadly. Slow the streets. Stop the repeat speeders. Do it before the next body hits the asphalt.</p><p>If you want this to move, push it. <strong>Act now</strong> at our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
