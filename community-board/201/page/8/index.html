One morning. One car.</strong> On July 3rd, a Ford Mustang turned onto East 149th and Courtlandt. It struck a person in the crosswalk, then five more, then slammed into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The car had no plates. The street filled with pain and panic. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months, Bronx CB1 saw 5 deaths and 14 serious injuries. There were 849 crashes. 598 people hurt. Children, elders, workers. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=the-toll-grows-the-system-waits>The Toll Grows, The System Waits</h3><p>The Mustang crash is only the latest. Just months ago, a taxi killed a 61-year-old man on East 149th. A bus killed a cyclist at the same intersection. A moped passenger died on Bruckner. The names change. The pattern does not.</p><p><strong>Most victims are on foot or bike.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main threat. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds—they all take their share. The street is a gauntlet. “We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><h3 id=leaders-move-but-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move, But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, light up step streets, and legalize crossing mid-block. She voted to end jaywalking tickets and co-sponsored curb extension and speed hump bills. But the street keeps taking. The city passed laws. The deaths keep coming. <strong>No law yet stops a Mustang with no plates from mowing down six people.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.
