They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just this spring, a 57-year-old man on a bike was killed by a bus at East 149th and Brook. In June, a pedestrian was struck and killed by a taxi on East 149th.

It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-rest>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Rest</h2><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and trucks.</strong> Four killed, thirteen left with broken bodies.
