Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

The report lists unspecified contributing factors for the bicyclist but does not cite any driver errors explicitly. The collision caused damage to the sedan described as 'other' and to the bike's center front end. The incident highlights the dangers faced by unlicensed bicyclists in traffic interactions with motor vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The article states, “A wrong-way driver fleeing from police struck a bicyclist in Greenwich Village during a chase.” The suspect, pursued on foot by officers, entered a black sedan and hit the cyclist before escaping. Emergency services brought the 44-year-old victim to Bellevue Hospital; he survived. The suspect remains at large. The piece notes a sharp rise in injuries from police pursuits: 398 crashes and 315 injuries in the first eleven months of 2024, up 47% from the previous year. The NYPD is revising its pursuit policy after ten deaths in cases where “no drugs or guns were found.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
