They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just this spring, a 57-year-old man on a bike was killed by a bus at East 149th and Brook. In June, a pedestrian was struck and killed by a taxi on East 149th.

The report states the bus hit the woman as she crossed without a signal, causing her to fall and suffer a severe head injury with significant bleeding. The driver did not remain at the scene. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The report notes the pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but this is listed after the driver's error. The vehicle, a 2016 CHEV-TRUCK/BUS, showed no damage, and the point of impact was the left front bumper.

The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe.
