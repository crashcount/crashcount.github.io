Seven hundred forty-two are hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, Bronx CB1 has seen 1,067 crashes. Fifteen of those injuries were serious. These are not numbers. They are lives ended, bodies broken, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>Just this spring, a 52-year-old man was crushed and killed by an SUV on Morris Avenue. He was not at an intersection. He never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data records the loss</a>.

The families do not.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-young-old-no-one-spared>The Pattern: Young, Old, No One Spared</h2><p><strong>Children, elders, workers, riders, walkers.</strong> The violence does not discriminate. In the last year, 78 children under 18 were injured. Two people aged 18–24 died. Two more in their fifties. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><p>The killers are not strangers. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm</strong>—four deaths, 211 minor injuries, 96 moderate, 13 serious. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt dozens. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all draw blood, but the biggest toll comes from the biggest machines.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-need-for-more>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Need for More</h2><p>Some leaders have acted. <strong>State Senator Jose Serrano voted yes to curb repeat speeders</strong>—a bill to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted yes in committee</a>. Assembly Member Amanda Septimo co-sponsored the same bill in the Assembly. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">She put her name on it</a>. Council Member Diana Ayala backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. <a href=#citations>She co-sponsored it</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The streets do not wait for another committee meeting.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. <strong>Call your council member. Call your state reps. Demand they finish the job.</strong></p><p><strong>No more studies. No more excuses. Lower the speed limits. Build the barriers.
