They do not bring anyone back.</p><p>A man tries to cross East 149th and Morris. A van turns left. The man, Inza Fofana, 52, is struck. He dies at Lincoln Hospital. The driver stays. No arrest.

The city says it will make the streets safe. The city says, &ldquo;Every New Yorker deserves safe streets.&rdquo; But the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise. The laws come slow.

No one has been held to account.</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-yours>The Next Move Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor.
