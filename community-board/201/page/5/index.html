On the ground, it bleeds.</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>15 people are dead</strong> and <strong>2,387 are hurt</strong> in 3,763 crashes here. Pedestrians took 403 injuries and 6 deaths. Cyclists took 246 injuries and 3 deaths. Heavy vehicles—trucks and buses—added weight to the toll. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> shows the count.</p><h3 id=east-149th-keeps-taking-people>East 149th keeps taking people</h3><p>A taxi going straight on East 149th struck a 61‑year‑old man crossing outside an intersection. He never woke up. The dataset lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4735638</a> records it.</p><p>Three months later, a 52‑year‑old man died at E 149 St and Morris Ave in a three‑SUV chain reaction. The record lists him as a pedestrian “Other Actions in Roadway.” The death sits in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4803347</a>.</p><p>A 57‑year‑old cyclist was going straight on E 149 St at Brook Ave. A Nova bus made a left. He was thrown and died. The city log calls it a left turn. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4795059</a> is the source.</p><p>East 149 Street shows up on the hotspot list with deaths and dozens injured. So does Bruckner. The city’s own rollup names <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>EAST 149 STREET</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BRUCKNER BLVD</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-and-sirens>Nights and sirens</h3><p>The injuries stack up after dark. From 8 p.m. to midnight, injuries spike, with the 8 p.m. hour logging 145 injuries and 11 serious cases. Deaths hit at 9 p.m., 10 p.m., and 11 p.m. The clock is a weapon. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly data</a> shows it.</p><p>“Demand for curb space in the city is increasing,” DOT said in another context about curb changes uptown. The line fits here too, where trucks, buses, SUVs, bikes and feet all fight for inches. The quote comes from the Upper West Side rollout story and is sourced here: <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-digital-parking-system-on-the-uws-implemented-in-dead-of-night-DG4954621>West Side Spirit</a>.</p><h3 id=trucks-turn-bodies-break>Trucks turn. Bodies break.</h3><p>A tanker truck turned left at Bruckner and Southern. A moped came straight. A 22‑year‑old rear rider died. The entry lists a left turn by the truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4820106</a> says so.</p><p>Motorcycles are fragile here. At Saint Anns and East 156th, a 21‑year‑old rider was ejected and died after a collision with an SUV. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4747426</a> is the record.</p><p>The causes in the city ledger are dull words that hide hard endings: inattention, left turns, failure to yield, aggressive moves. “Other” covers the rest. In CB1, that “other” holds 7 deaths and 669 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The dataset</a> carries the weight.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one?</h3><p>Start with the corners that take the most. Harden left turns. Daylight the crosswalks on East 149 and at Bruckner. Give long leading walk signals. Focus night enforcement where the injuries spike. The map points to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>EAST 149 STREET</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BRUCKNER BLVD</a>.</p><p>Citywide, the tools are on the table. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, and NYC has the authority to set safer speeds. Our own reporting lays out the steps to drop speeds and rein in repeat speeders. See the plan in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> guide.</p><h3 id=who-will-stand-up-the-limit-who-will-tame-the-worst-drivers>Who will stand up the limit? Who will tame the worst drivers?</h3><p>Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set its own limits. Advocates push a 20 mph default. Our guide explains how to press City Hall and the Council. Read it here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>In Albany, lawmakers advanced bills to force speed‑limiting tech on repeat offenders. Senator Jose Serrano voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Assembly Member Amanda Septimo co‑sponsors the Assembly version, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>. The bill targets drivers who rack up points and camera tickets. The summaries are in the legislative records and in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.</p><p>This is not theory. In CB1, fifteen dead is not theory. It is a street, a corner, a turn, a body. Slow the cars. Fix the turns. Stop the repeat speeders.</p><p>Read, then act. One call can move a vote.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

Deadlines pass. Courts hold the answer. Fewer cars enter Manhattan. Millions flow to transit. The fight is bureaucratic, not on the street. Riders wait. The city’s pulse slows, but the outcome is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 23, 2025, that New York’s congestion pricing tolls remain in place despite three missed federal deadlines to remove them. The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan widens sidewalks by 46% and cuts traffic lanes from five to three, aiming to boost pedestrian access. However, the redesign omits dedicated bus and bike lanes. Advocates criticized the move: 'Two mayors have now disregarded city workers' plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques,' said Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance. Transportation Alternatives called the plan a failure, noting Fifth Avenue's slow bus speeds and lack of cycling infrastructure.
