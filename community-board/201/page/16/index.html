One morning. One car.</strong> On July 3rd, a Ford Mustang turned onto East 149th and Courtlandt. It struck a person in the crosswalk, then five more, then slammed into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The car had no plates. The street filled with pain and panic. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months, Bronx CB1 saw 5 deaths and 14 serious injuries. There were 849 crashes. 598 people hurt. Children, elders, workers. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=the-toll-grows-the-system-waits>The Toll Grows, The System Waits</h3><p>The Mustang crash is only the latest. Just months ago, a taxi killed a 61-year-old man on East 149th. A bus killed a cyclist at the same intersection. A moped passenger died on Bruckner. The names change. The pattern does not.</p><p><strong>Most victims are on foot or bike.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main threat. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds—they all take their share. The street is a gauntlet. “We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><h3 id=leaders-move-but-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move, But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, light up step streets, and legalize crossing mid-block. She voted to end jaywalking tickets and co-sponsored curb extension and speed hump bills. But the street keeps taking. The city passed laws. The deaths keep coming. <strong>No law yet stops a Mustang with no plates from mowing down six people.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Twenty-five lost since January. Most killed on streets without protection. Council Member Brooks-Powers calls for urgent investment in safer roads, especially in outer boroughs. Activists demand the city build protected bike lanes now. Promises have failed. Lives are lost.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2023, Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31) highlighted the deadly toll facing cyclists in New York City. The event, covered by amny.com, cited a study showing 25 bike riders killed since January, making this the deadliest year for cyclists since 1999. The matter summary states: 'New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999.' Brooks-Powers stressed the urgent need for investments in street infrastructure, especially in outer-borough communities. She joined advocates and fellow Council Member Diana Ayala in demanding the city fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets. The analysis found 94% of cyclist deaths occurred on streets without protected bike lanes. Activists and analysts called for immediate action to fast track the NYC Streets Plan and expand protected lanes, noting that only 3% of city streets have them, despite an 18.1% drop in injuries and deaths where they exist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
