On the ground, it bleeds.</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>15 people are dead</strong> and <strong>2,387 are hurt</strong> in 3,763 crashes here. Pedestrians took 403 injuries and 6 deaths. Cyclists took 246 injuries and 3 deaths. Heavy vehicles—trucks and buses—added weight to the toll. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> shows the count.</p><h3 id=east-149th-keeps-taking-people>East 149th keeps taking people</h3><p>A taxi going straight on East 149th struck a 61‑year‑old man crossing outside an intersection. He never woke up. The dataset lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4735638</a> records it.</p><p>Three months later, a 52‑year‑old man died at E 149 St and Morris Ave in a three‑SUV chain reaction. The record lists him as a pedestrian “Other Actions in Roadway.” The death sits in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4803347</a>.</p><p>A 57‑year‑old cyclist was going straight on E 149 St at Brook Ave. A Nova bus made a left. He was thrown and died. The city log calls it a left turn. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4795059</a> is the source.</p><p>East 149 Street shows up on the hotspot list with deaths and dozens injured. So does Bruckner. The city’s own rollup names <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>EAST 149 STREET</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BRUCKNER BLVD</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-and-sirens>Nights and sirens</h3><p>The injuries stack up after dark. From 8 p.m. to midnight, injuries spike, with the 8 p.m. hour logging 145 injuries and 11 serious cases. Deaths hit at 9 p.m., 10 p.m., and 11 p.m. The clock is a weapon. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly data</a> shows it.</p><p>“Demand for curb space in the city is increasing,” DOT said in another context about curb changes uptown. The line fits here too, where trucks, buses, SUVs, bikes and feet all fight for inches. The quote comes from the Upper West Side rollout story and is sourced here: <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-digital-parking-system-on-the-uws-implemented-in-dead-of-night-DG4954621>West Side Spirit</a>.</p><h3 id=trucks-turn-bodies-break>Trucks turn. Bodies break.</h3><p>A tanker truck turned left at Bruckner and Southern. A moped came straight. A 22‑year‑old rear rider died. The entry lists a left turn by the truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4820106</a> says so.</p><p>Motorcycles are fragile here. At Saint Anns and East 156th, a 21‑year‑old rider was ejected and died after a collision with an SUV. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4747426</a> is the record.</p><p>The causes in the city ledger are dull words that hide hard endings: inattention, left turns, failure to yield, aggressive moves. “Other” covers the rest. In CB1, that “other” holds 7 deaths and 669 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The dataset</a> carries the weight.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one?</h3><p>Start with the corners that take the most. Harden left turns. Daylight the crosswalks on East 149 and at Bruckner. Give long leading walk signals. Focus night enforcement where the injuries spike. The map points to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>EAST 149 STREET</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BRUCKNER BLVD</a>.</p><p>Citywide, the tools are on the table. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, and NYC has the authority to set safer speeds. Our own reporting lays out the steps to drop speeds and rein in repeat speeders. See the plan in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> guide.</p><h3 id=who-will-stand-up-the-limit-who-will-tame-the-worst-drivers>Who will stand up the limit? Who will tame the worst drivers?</h3><p>Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set its own limits. Advocates push a 20 mph default. Our guide explains how to press City Hall and the Council. Read it here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>In Albany, lawmakers advanced bills to force speed‑limiting tech on repeat offenders. Senator Jose Serrano voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Assembly Member Amanda Septimo co‑sponsors the Assembly version, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>. The bill targets drivers who rack up points and camera tickets. The summaries are in the legislative records and in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.</p><p>This is not theory. In CB1, fifteen dead is not theory. It is a street, a corner, a turn, a body. Slow the cars. Fix the turns. Stop the repeat speeders.</p><p>Read, then act. One call can move a vote.

The vehicle sustained front-end damage, highlighting the dangers of excessive speed on high-speed ramps.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 24-year-old female driver was injured in a crash on the Major Deegan Expressway ramp around 12:30 a.m. The sedan, traveling north and going straight ahead, impacted with its left front bumper, causing center front end damage. The report cites "Unsafe Speed" as a contributing factor to the collision. The driver was not ejected but suffered head injuries and was incoherent at the scene, with minor bleeding reported. The driver was licensed in New York and the vehicle was a 2025 Kia sedan. No other vehicles or pedestrians were involved. The crash underscores the critical role of driver error, specifically unsafe speed, in causing serious injury on high-speed expressway ramps.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Clear markings mean fewer deadly gaps for walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1160-2025, now enacted, passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and full Council in February 2025. The law demands the Department of Transportation install pavement markings or temporary lines within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must notify the public and explain the delay. The bill’s matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law took effect March 15, 2025.
