Fourteen people have died since 2022. Forty-nine more have been seriously injured. The numbers do not flinch. They do not blink. They do not bring anyone back.</p><p>A man tries to cross East 149th and Morris. A van turns left. The man, Inza Fofana, 52, is struck. He dies at Lincoln Hospital. The driver stays. No arrest.

The city says it will make the streets safe. The city says, &ldquo;Every New Yorker deserves safe streets.&rdquo; But the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise. The laws come slow. The changes come slower. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. Speed limits drop, but only on some streets. The rest wait.</p><p>No one has been charged in the latest deaths. No one has been held to account.</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-yours>The Next Move Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.

The SUV’s front end struck the sedan’s right rear bumper. The report identifies 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor, indicating the SUV driver failed to maintain safe distance while the sedan was merging. The sedan carried two occupants; the left rear passenger, a 56-year-old female, was injured with neck trauma and experienced shock. She was restrained with a lap belt and harness and was not ejected. The report does not list any contributing factors related to the passenger. The collision underscores the dangers of tailgating and merging maneuvers on fast-moving expressways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
