These are the weapons. Cars and trucks killed or seriously injured 103 people walking in Bronx CB1 since 2022. Motorcycles and mopeds: 4. Bikes: 3. The street does not care who you are.

The city says it will make the streets safe. The city says, &ldquo;Every New Yorker deserves safe streets.&rdquo; But the blood on the crosswalks says otherwise. The laws come slow. The changes come slower. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. Speed limits drop, but only on some streets. The rest wait.</p><p>No one has been charged in the latest deaths.
