In three and a half years, <strong>twelve people have died</strong> and <strong>over 1,600 have been hurt</strong> on these streets. Most were walking or riding. Most never saw it coming.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Just last year, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at 8th Avenue and West 25th. The driver was in an SUV, turning left, not yielding. She died from head injuries. The crash report lists &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention&rdquo; as causes. The driver was unlicensed. The woman never made it to the other side, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist died on West 36th Street.

Assembly Member Tony Simone <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills</a> to expand speed camera enforcement and hold reckless drivers accountable. Council Member Erik Bottcher sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, a simple fix that saves lives. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day someone doesn’t come home.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the crossings, and end the silence. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop on its own. It takes a city to end it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The sky remains loud.</p><p class=mb3>"We’re not a bunch of zoo animals in New York City to be viewed by tourists flying overhead." -- Brad Hoylman-Sigal</p><p class=mb3>On December 12, 2022, the New York City Council, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, introduced a bill to ban non-essential helicopter flights from city heliports. The bill, discussed in oversight hearings, remains stalled. The matter summary states: 'Noise complaints from helicopters over New York City have soared in recent years, but lawmakers at city, state, and federal levels have failed to significantly reduce non-essential helicopter flights.' Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed. The Federal Aviation Administration’s authority blocks local control. Helicopter noise and pollution continue to harm New Yorkers, especially in vulnerable neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
