Eleven left with injuries so severe they changed lives.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Manhattan CB4. The numbers are steady, unyielding. In three and a half years, <strong>twelve people have died</strong> and <strong>over 1,600 have been hurt</strong> on these streets. Most were walking or riding. Most never saw it coming.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Just last year, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at 8th Avenue and West 25th. The driver was in an SUV, turning left, not yielding. She died from head injuries. The crash report lists &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention&rdquo; as causes. The driver was unlicensed. The woman never made it to the other side, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist died on West 36th Street. She was hit by an e-bike. The city calls it &ldquo;driver inexperience&rdquo; and &ldquo;distraction.&rdquo; The details are spare. The loss is not.</p><h3 id=the-voices-on-the-street>The Voices on the Street</h3><p>People see what’s happening. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a woman named Nita</a>. Another resident put it plain: &ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Jordan</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on a bill to require speed limiters for repeat speeders, aiming to keep the worst drivers from killing again. Assembly Member Tony Simone <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills</a> to expand speed camera enforcement and hold reckless drivers accountable. Council Member Erik Bottcher sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, a simple fix that saves lives. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day someone doesn’t come home.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the crossings, and end the silence. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop on its own. It takes a city to end it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers.
