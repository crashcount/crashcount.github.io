Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>1,573 have been injured</strong>. Thirty-five of those wounds were serious enough to change a life forever (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Just last week, a van crashed in Midtown. Firefighters found <strong>76 propane tanks</strong> and <strong>15 fuel canisters</strong> inside. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The street could have gone up in flames. The city called it a violation. The rest of us call it luck (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-van-propane-gas-tanks/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists do not walk away. <strong>Cars and trucks</strong> have killed four. <strong>Bikes</strong> have left two with serious injuries. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds</strong> have done the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in the crosswalk, bikes twisted under bumpers, families waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p>A city worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault&rdquo;</a> and said, &ldquo;Our thoughts are with our employee and their loved ones, and we hope they make a quick recovery&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>amny</a>). The worker was fixing a sign. The cyclist fled.

These are steps. But the blood keeps coming.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done it everywhere. Cameras catch some, but not all. Enforcement comes down hardest on those with the least power. The rest slip through.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against the drivers who kill and maim. Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It demands speed governors in new cars and direct visibility for heavy SUVs. The measure aims to cut traffic deaths and force safer vehicles onto New York streets. Oversized cars face new scrutiny.</p><p class=mb3>On August 12, 2022, Manhattan State Senator Brad Hoylman introduced a bill in the New York State Senate. The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced August 12, 2022, it awaits committee review. The bill 'mandates the use of advanced safety technology in vehicles in the state; requires the commissioner of motor vehicles to promulgate certain rules and regulations.' Hoylman leads the push. No votes or further actions recorded. The proposal could shape how cars interact with people on city streets, but the impact on pedestrians and cyclists is not yet clear. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They call out broken promises and demand action. The MTA stalls. The neighborhood waits. Riders walk farther. Streets stay dangerous. The city delays. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2022, Council Member Erik Bottcher, Rep. Jerry Nadler, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, State Sen. Brad Hoylman, and Assembly Members Dick Gottfried and Linda Rosenthal rallied for the 7 train station at 41st Street and 10th Avenue. The station, once promised as part of the Hudson Yards rezoning, was cut to save money. Bottcher called the cut a 'huge mistake.' Hoylman said it was a 'bait and switch.' Nadler pledged to fight for federal funding. The MTA said it would study the project. The matter: 'Pols and advocates are calling on the MTA to finally build the promised 7 train station at 41st Street and 10th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen.' No formal bill number or committee was cited. The lack of a station keeps riders on foot longer, exposing them to traffic and danger. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
