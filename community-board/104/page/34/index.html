Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 12, 2022, the City Council held an oversight hearing on placard abuse and enforcement. The new Department of Investigation (DOI) boss, Jocelyn Strauber, hesitated to confirm if placard abuse is a problem, despite a 2019 law requiring DOI and NYPD to investigate and report on the issue. Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement. The result: curb space remains dangerous and inaccessible for pedestrians, cyclists, and those who need it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law ordered NYPD to inspect 25 blocks weekly for placard abuse and another 25 for blocked bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, and crosswalks. The Department of Investigation (DOI) was to review and report by September 30, 2020. Agencies missed deadlines, citing pandemic and staffing shortages. Councilmember Erik Bottcher, representing District 3, pressed for action, saying businesses suffered from fake placards. The hearing highlighted the matter: 'Standing still zone: Two-year-old parking placard abuse probe stuck in bureaucratic time warp, NYC investigator blames COVID.' Advocates and @placardabuse called the delays corrupt and dangerous. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said placard abuse is no victimless crime, making streets more dangerous and slowing buses.
