Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents District 47, praised the work: "There is a fundamental right to access mass transit. And today we are taking an important step forward in making that right real to all New Yorkers." The upgrades will make the complex fully accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Still, 23 other stations remain on hold after congestion pricing was paused, freezing $15 billion in planned improvements. Only 30% of stations are accessible.

The matter, titled 'MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme,' highlights the urgency of MTA financing. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick noted Hochul’s commitment to a replacement plan. The bill’s status remains in flux, with no committee or vote recorded. The safety impact for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—was not assessed.
