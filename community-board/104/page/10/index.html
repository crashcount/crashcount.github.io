Two dozen injured. Hundreds of crashes.</strong> That’s just this year in Manhattan CB4. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. In the last twelve months, 935 crashes tore through these blocks. One person died. Eight suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Four hundred fifty-three were hurt. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp on.</p><p>Last year, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at 8th Avenue and West 25th. The driver turned left, did not yield, and struck her head-on. She died there, in the crosswalk. The driver was unlicensed. The cause: <strong>failure to yield and inattention</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist died on West 36th. A truck crushed a man on West 40th. The list runs long. Each name, a life cut short or broken.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p><strong>Council Member Erik Bottcher has sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and automate bike lane enforcement.</strong> He voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from pedestrians and toward those behind the wheel. But the pace is slow. The bill to ban parking near crosswalks—daylighting—still sits in committee. The dead wait for no one.</p><p>Bottcher praised the new protected bike lane on Sixth Avenue, saying, “<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike.</a>” But the lanes come one by one, while crashes come every day.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every delay is a risk. Every unprotected crossing is a dare.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every intersection. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. But power unused is no comfort to the grieving.</p><p>As the city drags its feet, the toll mounts. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fdny-update-on-port-authority-bus-terminal-crash-full-news-conference/>one FDNY chief said</a> after a bus crash at Port Authority, “One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals.” The words are dry. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every avenue.</strong> The city will not move until you push. The dead cannot wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
