Two dozen injured. Hundreds of crashes.</strong> That’s just this year in Manhattan CB4. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. In the last twelve months, 935 crashes tore through these blocks. One person died. Eight suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Four hundred fifty-three were hurt. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp on.</p><p>Last year, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at 8th Avenue and West 25th. The driver turned left, did not yield, and struck her head-on. She died there, in the crosswalk. The driver was unlicensed. The cause: <strong>failure to yield and inattention</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist died on West 36th. A truck crushed a man on West 40th. The list runs long. Each name, a life cut short or broken.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p><strong>Council Member Erik Bottcher has sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and automate bike lane enforcement.</strong> He voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from pedestrians and toward those behind the wheel. But the pace is slow. The bill to ban parking near crosswalks—daylighting—still sits in committee. The dead wait for no one.</p><p>Bottcher praised the new protected bike lane on Sixth Avenue, saying, “<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike.</a>” But the lanes come one by one, while crashes come every day.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every delay is a risk. Every unprotected crossing is a dare.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every intersection. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. But power unused is no comfort to the grieving.</p><p>As the city drags its feet, the toll mounts. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fdny-update-on-port-authority-bus-terminal-crash-full-news-conference/>one FDNY chief said</a> after a bus crash at Port Authority, “One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals.” The words are dry. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every avenue.</strong> The city will not move until you push. The dead cannot wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police claim safety, but data show cars and trucks cause most harm. App companies profit. Immigrant workers pay. Advocates say crackdowns punish the vulnerable, not the reckless. The city misses the real threat.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2023, NYPD officers from Brooklyn’s 78th Precinct seized illegal mopeds from delivery workers outside fast-food chains. The enforcement action follows years of crackdowns dating back to Mayor Bloomberg, ramped up under Mayor de Blasio. Police say the seizures make streets safer, but city crash data show cars and trucks—not e-bikes or mopeds—cause most pedestrian injuries. Delivery worker Roziev Akmal warned, 'Livelihoods will be ruined because of the seizure.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called it 'another example where you see deliveristas being economically impacted.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Gale Brewer cited constituent complaints, but advocates and legal experts argue enforcement targets workers, not the root causes. The crackdown leaves low-paid, mostly immigrant workers exposed to fines, lost income, and road danger, while app companies escape responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as giving 'absolute priority for pedestrians,' will remove 70,000 parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, widen sidewalks, and expand bike lanes. Hidalgo rejects harsh measures against e-bikes, focusing instead on reducing car dominance and discouraging SUVs through progressive parking fees. Council Member Gale A. Brewer, District 6, is mentioned in the context of New York’s contrasting approach, where enforcement often targets e-bikes rather than cars. Advocates highlight that cars and trucks cause most pedestrian injuries and deaths. They urge New York to emulate Paris—reclaiming street space from cars, not blaming micromobility. The data is clear: fewer cars mean safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

After three violations in a year, the vehicle would be towed if found in violation again. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing penalties for alternate side parking violations and requiring towing of certain vehicles in violation of alternate side parking rules.' Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor) led the effort. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

The bill would let New York City set its own speed limits. It passed the Senate but died in the Assembly. Advocates and families mourn another delay. Streets stay fast. Vulnerable lives remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, a bill to let New York City set and lower its speed limits, stalled in the Assembly on June 19, 2023. The bill passed the state Senate but did not reach a vote in the Assembly, blocked by Speaker Carl Heastie and opposition from outerborough members. The City Council, including Councilwoman Jennifer Gutiérrez, supported the measure with a home rule message. The bill’s summary: 'allow New York City to set speed limits as low as 10 mph on some streets and 20 mph citywide.' Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal sponsored the bill in the Assembly. Governor Hochul and Mayor Adams both backed it. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal called it 'common sense.' Advocates, including Amy Cohen, mother of the bill’s namesake, vow to keep fighting. No safety analyst note was provided, but the bill’s failure leaves city streets unchanged and vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
