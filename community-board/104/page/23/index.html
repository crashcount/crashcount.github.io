Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>1,573 have been injured</strong>. Thirty-five of those wounds were serious enough to change a life forever (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Just last week, a van crashed in Midtown. Firefighters found <strong>76 propane tanks</strong> and <strong>15 fuel canisters</strong> inside. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The street could have gone up in flames. The city called it a violation. The rest of us call it luck (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-van-propane-gas-tanks/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists do not walk away. <strong>Cars and trucks</strong> have killed four. <strong>Bikes</strong> have left two with serious injuries. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds</strong> have done the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in the crosswalk, bikes twisted under bumpers, families waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p>A city worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault&rdquo;</a> and said, &ldquo;Our thoughts are with our employee and their loved ones, and we hope they make a quick recovery&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>amny</a>). The worker was fixing a sign. The cyclist fled. The street was quiet again, but nothing was fixed.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-silence-between>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Silence Between</h2><p>Local leaders have moved. <strong>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal</strong> <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on a bill</a> to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. <strong>Assembly Member Tony Simone</strong> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> to expand speed camera enforcement. These are steps. But the blood keeps coming.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done it everywhere. Cameras catch some, but not all. Enforcement comes down hardest on those with the least power. The rest slip through.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against the drivers who kill and maim. Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crisis demands a fix beyond punishing workers.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, published August 23, 2023, analyzes New York City’s 'moped crisis.' The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
