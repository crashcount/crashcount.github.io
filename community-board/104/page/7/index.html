Thirty-five were hurt so badly they may never walk the same again. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in crosswalks, bikes twisted on the curb, families waiting for a phone that will never ring.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs lead the count.</strong> They killed two, left 315 more battered or broken. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless—two serious injuries, fifty hurt by bikes, twenty by mopeds and motorcycles. But the weight of steel does most of the damage. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=this-weeks-wounds>This Week’s Wounds</h3><p>The violence is not history. It is now. Just days ago, a city worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss at Broadway and Cedar. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault”</a>. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said</a>, &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something.&rdquo; The worker bled on the sidewalk. The cyclist fled. No one has been arrested.</p><p>On July 15, a van loaded with <strong>76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline</strong> crashed in Midtown. The food cart it was towing broke loose and slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Both went to the hospital. The driver faces reckless endangerment charges. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-arrested-nypd-discovers-75-gallons-gasoline-10-diesel-inside-van-manhattan-nyc/17154624/>Hazmat teams emptied the van</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Local leaders have moved. <strong>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal</strong> voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. He also co-sponsored bills for more camera enforcement and safer bike lanes. <strong>Assembly Member Tony Simone</strong> co-sponsored bills to expand speed cameras and hold reckless drivers accountable. But both have also backed bills that could weaken camera enforcement. The fight is not finished.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next?

The matter, titled 'Hochul will defy Trump deadline to stop NYC congestion pricing — but insists president still backs her Penn Station revamp plan,' centers on Governor Hochul’s refusal to halt congestion pricing despite federal pressure. Simone, representing the Penn Station area, voiced support for both congestion pricing and a bold Penn Station overhaul, saying, 'It’s time to build a big bold Penn Station. I’m glad that she’s talking to the president about it.' He opposed linking the two projects, stating, 'I don’t think they should be connected.' Simone also welcomed Hochul’s resistance to Amtrak’s expansion plans that would raze neighborhoods.
