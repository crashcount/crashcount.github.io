Thirty-five seriously hurt. Over 1,600 injured.</strong> That’s the toll in Manhattan CB4 since 2022. These are not just numbers. Each represents a body on the street, a family left waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p>Last year, a 39-year-old pedestrian was crushed by a box truck on West 40th Street. A 29-year-old woman was killed on 9th Avenue. An 86-year-old crossing with the signal was struck and killed by an SUV whose driver failed to yield. The old, the young, the careful, the unlucky. The street does not care.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they killed at least four people and left hundreds more with broken bodies. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—pay the highest price.</p><p>The city’s response is slow. The carnage is not. In the words of the FDNY, after firefighter Matthew Goicochea was killed on the FDR Drive, the department <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/decorated-firefighter-killed-after-falling-off-motorcycle-getting-hit-by-car-on-fdr-drive-GG4877945>said</a>, “We lost a true hero this morning with the tragic passing of Firefighter Matthew Goicochea&mldr;His dedication to serving and protecting New Yorkers&mldr;exemplifies the selflessness and courage that define all of New York&rsquo;s Bravest.”</p><p>A hit-and-run.

Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. Assembly Member Tony Simone <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills to expand speed camera enforcement</a> and hold vehicle owners liable. Council Member Erik Bottcher sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. These are steps, not solutions. The blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong></p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p><strong>Call your council member.
