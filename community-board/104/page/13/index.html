Two dozen injured. Hundreds of crashes.</strong> That’s just this year in Manhattan CB4. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. In the last twelve months, 935 crashes tore through these blocks. One person died. Eight suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Four hundred fifty-three were hurt. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp on.</p><p>Last year, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at 8th Avenue and West 25th. The driver turned left, did not yield, and struck her head-on. She died there, in the crosswalk. The driver was unlicensed. The cause: <strong>failure to yield and inattention</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist died on West 36th. A truck crushed a man on West 40th. The list runs long. Each name, a life cut short or broken.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p><strong>Council Member Erik Bottcher has sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and automate bike lane enforcement.</strong> He voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from pedestrians and toward those behind the wheel. But the pace is slow. The bill to ban parking near crosswalks—daylighting—still sits in committee. The dead wait for no one.</p><p>Bottcher praised the new protected bike lane on Sixth Avenue, saying, “<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike.</a>” But the lanes come one by one, while crashes come every day.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every delay is a risk. Every unprotected crossing is a dare.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every intersection. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. But power unused is no comfort to the grieving.</p><p>As the city drags its feet, the toll mounts. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fdny-update-on-port-authority-bus-terminal-crash-full-news-conference/>one FDNY chief said</a> after a bus crash at Port Authority, “One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals.” The words are dry. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every avenue.</strong> The city will not move until you push. The dead cannot wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, follows years of parent-led advocacy. The measure excludes major multi-lane roads but targets most city streets. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2024, state lawmakers advanced legislation enabling New York City to reduce its default speed limit to 20 mph. The measure, known as Sammy’s Law, is part of the state budget deal and awaits final publication. Sponsored by Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal and Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the bill allows the City Council to set lower limits on most streets, but excludes roads with three or more lanes in one direction. The bill’s title honors Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a speeding driver in 2013. Rosenthal said, “This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower.” Hoylman-Sigal credited persistent advocacy by Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets. The City Council and Mayor must still approve the change. Advocates and city officials say the law gives New York City a vital tool to prevent traffic violence and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Oswald Feliz leads as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Bottcher, Gennaro, Marte, Restler, Ung, and Paladino.
