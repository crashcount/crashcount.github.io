Eleven left with injuries so severe they changed lives.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Manhattan CB4. The numbers are steady, unyielding. In three and a half years, <strong>twelve people have died</strong> and <strong>over 1,600 have been hurt</strong> on these streets. Most were walking or riding. Most never saw it coming.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Just last year, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at 8th Avenue and West 25th. The driver was in an SUV, turning left, not yielding. She died from head injuries. The crash report lists &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention&rdquo; as causes. The driver was unlicensed. The woman never made it to the other side, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist died on West 36th Street. She was hit by an e-bike. The city calls it &ldquo;driver inexperience&rdquo; and &ldquo;distraction.&rdquo; The details are spare. The loss is not.</p><h3 id=the-voices-on-the-street>The Voices on the Street</h3><p>People see what’s happening. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a woman named Nita</a>. Another resident put it plain: &ldquo;The crowding and the traffic signals are a problem,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Jordan</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> on a bill to require speed limiters for repeat speeders, aiming to keep the worst drivers from killing again. Assembly Member Tony Simone <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills</a> to expand speed camera enforcement and hold reckless drivers accountable. Council Member Erik Bottcher sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, a simple fix that saves lives. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day someone doesn’t come home.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the crossings, and end the silence. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop on its own. It takes a city to end it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

The article, titled 'Opinion: Worried About E-Bike Safety? Make the Roads Safer First,' highlights the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians due to poor infrastructure. It supports Council Member Lincoln Restler’s bill to enforce bike and bus lane obstruction rules and backs state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal’s proposal for employer-based delivery worker licensing. The piece states: 'Such proposals are heavy-handed and will deter and discourage e-bike ridership without effectively ensuring their safe operations on the street.' The author urges protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and moving Citi Bike docks off sidewalks. The message is clear: systemic fixes, not punitive measures, protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT warns, 'motorists should expect the slowest traffic of the year in Midtown,' with average speeds dipping below 4 mph and key streets closed. Hoylman-Sigal, co-author of a new traffic report, highlights that Midtown speeds are the slowest since records began—20% slower than a decade ago. The report notes emergency response times have suffered. DOT continues a temporary bike lane for cyclists and micro-mobility users, with plans for a permanent design. Hoylman-Sigal supports congestion pricing and safer streets, but Governor Hochul has paused the plan. The city expects more gridlock days through December.
