Two dozen injured. Hundreds of crashes.</strong> That’s just this year in Manhattan CB4. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. In the last twelve months, 935 crashes tore through these blocks. One person died. Eight suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Four hundred fifty-three were hurt. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp on.</p><p>Last year, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at 8th Avenue and West 25th. The driver turned left, did not yield, and struck her head-on. She died there, in the crosswalk. The driver was unlicensed. The cause: <strong>failure to yield and inattention</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist died on West 36th. A truck crushed a man on West 40th. The list runs long. Each name, a life cut short or broken.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p><strong>Council Member Erik Bottcher has sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and automate bike lane enforcement.</strong> He voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from pedestrians and toward those behind the wheel. But the pace is slow. The bill to ban parking near crosswalks—daylighting—still sits in committee. The dead wait for no one.</p><p>Bottcher praised the new protected bike lane on Sixth Avenue, saying, “<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike.</a>” But the lanes come one by one, while crashes come every day.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every delay is a risk. Every unprotected crossing is a dare.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every intersection. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. But power unused is no comfort to the grieving.</p><p>As the city drags its feet, the toll mounts. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fdny-update-on-port-authority-bus-terminal-crash-full-news-conference/>one FDNY chief said</a> after a bus crash at Port Authority, “One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals.” The words are dry. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every avenue.</strong> The city will not move until you push. The dead cannot wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Opinion: Worried About E-Bike Safety? Make the Roads Safer First,' highlights the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians due to poor infrastructure. It supports Council Member Lincoln Restler’s bill to enforce bike and bus lane obstruction rules and backs state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal’s proposal for employer-based delivery worker licensing. The piece states: 'Such proposals are heavy-handed and will deter and discourage e-bike ridership without effectively ensuring their safe operations on the street.' The author urges protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and moving Citi Bike docks off sidewalks.

Anti-bike voices rage as double-parked cars and reckless drivers menace Long Island City. A cyclist is struck in Brooklyn. Universal daylighting advances. The city’s streets remain dangerous for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On September 23, 2024, Streetsblog NYC published a media commentary titled 'Monday’s Headlines: ‘It’s the Car Culture, Stupid’ Edition.' The piece criticizes The New York Times for failing to address the harm car culture inflicts on public health and urban safety, quoting, 'The Times is so blind to car culture that it can't even blame the automobile for sedentary lifestyles.' The article highlights ongoing dangers for pedestrians and cyclists, including a cyclist struck by a driver in Brooklyn and persistent double-parking in Long Island City. It notes an Upper Manhattan community board’s vote for universal daylighting, a proven safety measure. No council members are directly named, but the commentary centers the systemic risks cars pose to vulnerable road users and the media’s failure to confront these dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No relief in sight.</p><p class=mb3>On September 23, 2024, State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and the New York City Department of Transportation announced the slowest Manhattan traffic of the year as the United Nations General Assembly convenes. The DOT warns, 'motorists should expect the slowest traffic of the year in Midtown,' with average speeds dipping below 4 mph and key streets closed. Hoylman-Sigal, co-author of a new traffic report, highlights that Midtown speeds are the slowest since records began—20% slower than a decade ago. The report notes emergency response times have suffered. DOT continues a temporary bike lane for cyclists and micro-mobility users, with plans for a permanent design. Hoylman-Sigal supports congestion pricing and safer streets, but Governor Hochul has paused the plan. The city expects more gridlock days through December. Vulnerable road users face narrowed space and slower emergency help as cars choke Midtown.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
