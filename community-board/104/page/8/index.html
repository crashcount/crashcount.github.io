Two dozen injured. Hundreds of crashes.</strong> That’s just this year in Manhattan CB4. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. In the last twelve months, 935 crashes tore through these blocks. One person died. Eight suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Four hundred fifty-three were hurt. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp on.</p><p>Last year, an 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light at 8th Avenue and West 25th. The driver turned left, did not yield, and struck her head-on. She died there, in the crosswalk. The driver was unlicensed. The cause: <strong>failure to yield and inattention</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old cyclist died on West 36th. A truck crushed a man on West 40th. The list runs long. Each name, a life cut short or broken.</p><h3 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p><strong>Council Member Erik Bottcher has sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and automate bike lane enforcement.</strong> He voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from pedestrians and toward those behind the wheel. But the pace is slow. The bill to ban parking near crosswalks—daylighting—still sits in committee. The dead wait for no one.</p><p>Bottcher praised the new protected bike lane on Sixth Avenue, saying, “<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike.</a>” But the lanes come one by one, while crashes come every day.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every delay is a risk. Every unprotected crossing is a dare.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every intersection. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. But power unused is no comfort to the grieving.</p><p>As the city drags its feet, the toll mounts. As <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fdny-update-on-port-authority-bus-terminal-crash-full-news-conference/>one FDNY chief said</a> after a bus crash at Port Authority, “One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals.” The words are dry. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every avenue.</strong> The city will not move until you push. The dead cannot wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The DOT warns, 'motorists should expect the slowest traffic of the year in Midtown,' with average speeds dipping below 4 mph and key streets closed. Hoylman-Sigal, co-author of a new traffic report, highlights that Midtown speeds are the slowest since records began—20% slower than a decade ago. The report notes emergency response times have suffered. DOT continues a temporary bike lane for cyclists and micro-mobility users, with plans for a permanent design. Hoylman-Sigal supports congestion pricing and safer streets, but Governor Hochul has paused the plan. The city expects more gridlock days through December. Vulnerable road users face narrowed space and slower emergency help as cars choke Midtown.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A sedan traveling eastbound rear-ended a bicyclist also moving eastbound. The bicyclist, a 51-year-old man, was injured in the back and remained conscious after the impact.

The sedan's point of impact was the center front end, while the bike was struck at the center back end. The bicyclist was not ejected and was wearing a helmet, but no contributing factors related to the victim were noted. Vehicle damage was reported on the bike but not on the sedan.
