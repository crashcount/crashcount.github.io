The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

City stalls while engines roar.</p><p class=mb3>On May 17, 2022, Council Member Erik Bottcher introduced a bill to raise penalties for repeat car noise violations. Council Member Bob Holden sponsored two more bills targeting cars with exterior speakers and personal audio devices. The matter, titled 'Pols Want City Crackdown on Car Noise, But Health Department is Silent,' highlights council frustration with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which has not acted. Council Member Carlina Rivera called noise pollution a public health crisis and urged health-focused street design, citing the 14th Street busway. Transportation Alternatives backed the bills, pushing for more pedestrian and green space. Dr. Arline Bronzaft and other experts criticized the Health Department's inaction. The article points to London's Healthy Streets as a model. The council's push centers public health and the safety of those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City defends slow rollout.</p><p class=mb3>On May 10, 2022, advocates criticized the Clean Curbs pilot, a $1.3-million initiative announced in 2020 and led by the Department of Sanitation (DSNY). The pilot aims to reduce sidewalk trash piles by testing curbside enclosures. The commercial phase launched with two, four-bin units in Times Square, funded by the Times Square Alliance. The residential phase will cover a single Manhattan block, using nine enclosures and removing six parking spaces. Advocates argue, as the matter states, 'the city's 'Clean Curbs' pilot is too small and unambitious to be scalable citywide.' Council Member Erik Bottcher, a leader on trash issues, is linked to the pilot’s district but declined comment. Local group CHEKPEDS also declined. Advocates want a broader test, more bins, and better truck equipment. DSNY spokesman Vincent Gragnani says, 'The $1.3-million Clean Curbs pilot is exactly that, a pilot that will allow us to see what works and what does not work.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot, announced in 2020, launched with two enclosures in Times Square and plans for nine more on a single Manhattan block. The matter summary warns, 'the city's 'Clean Curbs' pilot is too small and unambitious to be scalable citywide.' Council Member Erik Bottcher, District 3, known for trash reform, was mentioned but declined comment. Advocates and local groups like CHEKPEDS also withheld statements. Critics argue the pilot’s limited scope cannot yield meaningful data or real change. They call for a broader, comprehensive approach to keep sidewalks clear and safe for pedestrians. The Department of Sanitation defends the pilot as a test run. For now, the city’s most vulnerable remain at risk amid crowded curbs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
