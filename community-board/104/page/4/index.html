The 2023 Council bill banned street-side dining from December to March, restoring thousands of spaces to private car storage. The bill’s summary notes, 'outdoor dining is shrinking back to wealthier neighborhoods.' Mayor Adams signed the regulations. Assembly Member Tony Simone called the process 'overburdensome.' Advocates like Sara Lind and Christine Berthet slammed the rules as inequitable and harmful to pedestrians, saying sidewalk cafes now crowd walking space while car parking is prioritized. The Department of Transportation and Council trade blame for the system’s failures. Small businesses face high fees and complex applications, locking out many restaurants. Pedestrian advocates warn the new law pushes more tables into sidewalk space, squeezing walkers and prioritizing cars over people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Hochul will defy Trump deadline to stop NYC congestion pricing — but insists president still backs her Penn Station revamp plan,' centers on Governor Hochul’s refusal to halt congestion pricing despite federal pressure. Simone, representing the Penn Station area, voiced support for both congestion pricing and a bold Penn Station overhaul, saying, 'It’s time to build a big bold Penn Station. I’m glad that she’s talking to the president about it.' He opposed linking the two projects, stating, 'I don’t think they should be connected.'
