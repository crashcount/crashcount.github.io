Introduced January 13, 2023, the bill 'enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles.' Jonathan Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by over 70 co-sponsors including Patrick Burke, Kenny Burgos, and Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or vote. Its language centers the safety of all road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers—by demanding infrastructure that reduces risk and prioritizes vulnerable people. The measure reflects growing legislative momentum for street design that saves lives and prevents injury. The urgency is clear: New York streets remain dangerous.

She wants Albany to let New York City set its own speed limits. Advocates and city officials support her. Lower speeds mean fewer deaths. The fight now moves to the legislature. Streets could get safer. The city waits.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul announced her support for a state bill—known as Sammy’s Law—that would let New York City lower its own speed limits. The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Three pedestrians have died since 2016.</p><p class=mb3>On November 21, 2022, the Department of Transportation unveiled a plan for a parking-protected bike lane on nearly 40 blocks of 10th Avenue, stretching from W. 14th to W. 52nd streets. Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits. The agency aims to start work in spring and finish by fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
