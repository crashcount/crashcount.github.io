The male pickup driver and the female SUV driver were injured; both reported whiplash, and the SUV driver had shoulder trauma. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Traffic Control Disregarded.” That points to driver error at the intersection. The pickup’s point of impact was the left front bumper; the SUV’s was the center front end. No pedestrians or cyclists were listed, but the crash shows how a left turn and ignored control can maim people moving through the corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
