In the last twelve months, <strong>seven people died</strong> in crashes across Queens CB12. <strong>Thirteen more were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In all, <strong>1,460 people were hurt</strong>—bodies broken on Linden Boulevard, 116th Avenue, and the rest. The numbers do not flinch. They only grow.</p><p>Last week, a man on a stand-up scooter was hit by a van turning left at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. He died at the hospital. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>Police said</a></p><p>Two days before, two moped riders collided with a BMW in Jamaica.

Trucks and buses left dozens hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, 143 children were injured. Three people aged 18–24 died.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>The council passed a law to end jaywalking enforcement.

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking.&rdquo; <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The law</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. Promises pile up.

Safety slips away.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2025, Sophia Lebowitz spoke out against New York City's e-bike enforcement shift, as reported by Streetsblog NYC. No bill number or committee was cited. Lebowitz condemned City Hall's failure to regulate delivery app companies, saying, 'the city's failure to rein in the delivery industry created the current war on bikes.' The Adams administration now targets riders with criminal summonses and a proposed 15-mph e-bike speed limit. Delivery cyclists, many immigrants, face police crackdowns while app bosses avoid responsibility. The safety analyst notes: 'Failure to regulate the delivery industry often leads to increased conflicts, unsafe street conditions, and scapegoating of cyclists, undermining safety and discouraging active transportation.' Lebowitz's stance highlights how city inaction endangers vulnerable road users and shifts blame onto those least protected.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Politicians hold the line.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2025, mayoral candidates Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie publicly reaffirmed their support for retaining NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. This comes as Tisch’s department intensifies enforcement against cyclists. Streetsblog NYC reported, 'Both Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie, mayoral candidates, have reiterated their pledge to retain NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch if elected, despite concerns over her crackdown on cyclists.' Lander’s spokesperson, Kat Capossela, said Lander trusts Tisch to implement his policies, including cracking down on reckless drivers, even as Tisch currently targets cyclists. Myrie’s campaign promised to keep streets safe without unnecessary enforcement. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and former Comptroller Scott Stringer also weighed in, but stopped short of firm commitments. A safety analyst notes: Retaining a commissioner known for crackdowns on cyclists likely perpetuates enforcement-focused approaches that burden vulnerable road users, discouraging cycling and undermining mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
