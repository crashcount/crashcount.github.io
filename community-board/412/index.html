The driver, Bekim Fiseku, was wanted for burglary and had tape over his license plate. Police chased him nearly a mile through residential streets. A witness said, "She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood." Fiseku faces murder and manslaughter charges.

After a crash on the Van Wyck Expressway, Augustin assaulted Jasmer Singh, using slurs and violence. Prosecutors said Augustin yelled, 'No police, no police,' and called Singh 'turban man' before punching him. Singh died from the assault. Police were initially slow to pursue hate crime charges, but a grand jury and community pressure led to a harsher indictment. Augustin pleaded guilty to second-degree assault as a hate crime, avoiding a possible manslaughter conviction. The case highlights gaps in hate crime enforcement and the lethal risk of post-crash confrontations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
