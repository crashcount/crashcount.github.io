Thirty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> Five thousand more hurt since 2022. The wounds are not abstract. They are broken bones, crushed bodies, and families who will never be whole again.</p><p>Just this spring, a 62-year-old man was killed on Linden Boulevard. He was crossing. Two cars, an SUV and a sedan, struck him. He died there, on the street, not at an intersection, not in a crosswalk. The cause: driver inattention. The record says only &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; and &ldquo;semiconscious&rdquo; before death. No arrest. No comfort. Only silence (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 19-year-old on a moped died on 90th Avenue. Ejected. Apparent death. Helmet or not, it did not matter. The SUV kept going straight. The moped was demolished (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> In three years, they killed five, seriously injured twelve, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses injured dozens. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave bodies in the street. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The pattern is clear: the bigger the machine, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=words-from-the-wreckage>Words from the Wreckage</h3><p>After a crane slammed into a city bus in Queens Village, a survivor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>recalled</a>, <strong>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us. I was holding on for my life back there&rdquo;</strong>.</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a BMW went airborne. Passengers were thrown from the car.

She co-sponsored a bill to bring more light to dark corridors, but it sits stalled in committee. She backed a task force to study e-bike street safety, but the city is still waiting for action. <strong>Bills to protect the most vulnerable are too often delayed, studied, or ignored.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another body in the street.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just studies. Tell them: the dead cannot wait.

The driver, Bekim Fiseku, was wanted for burglary and had tape over his license plate. Police chased him nearly a mile through residential streets. A witness said, "She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood." Fiseku faces murder and manslaughter charges. The case raises questions about the risks of police chases in dense city neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
