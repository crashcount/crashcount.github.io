Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, seven families have buried loved ones. Over 1,400 have been hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, sons, daughters. They are neighbors who never made it home.</p><p>On Linden Boulevard, a man with a cane tried to cross the street. A car hit him. Another ran him over. His family said, <strong>&ldquo;Today is a sad day. We lost a brother, father, son, uncle, and cousin. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/30/man-62-killed-in-front-of-his-queens-home-by-hit-and-run-driver-second-motorist/>He has been snuffed from us by a hit and runner driver.</a>&rdquo;</strong></p><p>A few months earlier, a driver lost control on 90th Avenue. The crash crushed a garage and a life. <strong>&ldquo;That is a big loss for us,&rdquo;</strong> his cousin <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/01/22/uber-driver-died-queens-crash-worked-nights-spend-days-kids/>said</a>. <strong>&ldquo;He was a caregiver. That&rsquo;s very, very tough for us.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-pattern-wide-roads-fast-cars-no-escape>The Pattern: Wide Roads, Fast Cars, No Escape</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In the last twelve months, cars and trucks took seven lives and left thirteen with serious injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are wide. The speeds are high. The crossings are long. The danger is constant.</p><h3 id=the-response-promises-delays-and-the-need-for-action>The Response: Promises, Delays, and the Need for Action</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in Queens CB12, the blood keeps flowing. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Speed cameras save lives, but their future is always in doubt. <strong>Each day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand street redesigns that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not taken a public stance. Conservative members like Bob Holden oppose the plan, while City Planning Commission Chairman Dan Garodnick urges action: 'Your district needs to be part of the housing solution.'
