Thirteen seriously injured. In just the first half of this year, Queens CB12 saw 1,435 crashes—nearly a thousand people hurt. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on Linden Boulevard, 90th Avenue, Rockaway Boulevard. Families who will never be whole again.</p><p>On April 24, a 62-year-old man was struck and killed by two SUVs while crossing Linden Boulevard. The crash report lists &ldquo;failure to yield&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention&rdquo; as causes. He died at the scene. No second chances. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Just three months earlier, a 23-year-old pedestrian was killed at Rockaway Boulevard and North Conduit Avenue. He was crossing at the intersection. The car kept going.

Senator Leroy Comrie backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. He voted yes in committee, helping push the bill forward. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes in committee</a></p><p>Assembly Member Alicia Hyndman and Senator Comrie also voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children walking to class. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a></p><p>But the carnage continues. SUVs and cars do most of the killing. In this district, SUVs and sedans caused five pedestrian deaths and twelve serious injuries since 2022. Trucks, buses, and motorcycles add to the toll. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A bus jumps the curb in Flushing.

The MTA pulled the driver from service. The investigation drags on.</p><p>A mother, a father, a child. Each crash leaves a hole. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Jacqueline Cox</a>.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken.
