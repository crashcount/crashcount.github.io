The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. The living carry scars—broken bones, crushed bodies, memories that do not heal.</p><p>Just this spring, a 62-year-old man was killed crossing Linden Boulevard. He was hit by two SUVs. The crash report lists the cause as &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; He died alone, not at an intersection, not in a crosswalk. The street did not forgive him. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>On Christmas night, a woman was struck and killed at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. The driver kept going straight. The report says &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The only thing that stopped the car was her body. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-human-cost-voices-from-the-scene>The Human Cost: Voices from the Scene</h3><p>After a bus crash in Flushing, a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo; Eight people were hurt. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation goes on.</p><p>A mother at the scene <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>told reporters</a>, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo; But caution is not armor. The sidewalk is not safe.

These are the right votes. But the deaths keep coming. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so everywhere. The law is on the books. The blood is on the street.</p><p><strong>Every delay is another family broken.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-demand-relentless-action>What Next: Demand Relentless Action</h3><p><strong>Call your council member.
