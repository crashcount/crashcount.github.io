Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the toll in Queens CB12 in the past year. These are not just numbers. They are people. A man, 62, crushed by an SUV on Linden Boulevard. A 19-year-old, thrown from his moped, killed on 90th Avenue. A woman, 45, struck crossing 111th Avenue on Christmas night. Each one gone. Each one leaves a hole.</p><p>Just last week, a 23-year-old man was run down on 101st Street and Liberty Boulevard. Police said, &ldquo;Sonalall approached the driver&rsquo;s side window and flashed what appeared to be a gun, startling the motorist to the point that he drove off, striking the menace&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/01/us-news/man-23-fatally-run-over-by-ex-girlfriends-new-beau-in-love-triangle-clash-on-nyc-street-cops/>New York Post</a>). The DA filed no charges. The street is quiet again. The loss remains.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h2><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, 21 people died, 44 were seriously hurt, and over 5,300 were injured in 8,848 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). SUVs and sedans did most of the killing. Young men, old women, children—no one is spared. The dead are not just numbers. They are neighbors.</p><p>A mother’s words echo after her daughter’s death: &ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>Gothamist</a>).</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> Senator Leroy Comrie voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member Alicia Hyndman voted to extend school speed zones. But the carnage continues. There is no citywide 20 mph limit. There are no new safe crossings. There is no end to the waiting.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-waiting>The Cost of Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The streets do not forgive. The dead do not return. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. The law is on the books. The leaders have the phone lines. The families have the grief.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong> The time for waiting is over.

Critics warn of secrecy and developer giveaways.</p><p class=mb3>On July 27, 2022, the state’s Public Authorities Control Board approved Governor Kathy Hochul’s Penn Station redevelopment plan. The project, described as a 'once-in-a-generation opportunity,' includes 18 million square feet of new office towers, 1,800 apartments, a $7 billion station upgrade, and promises of walkable streets and bike lanes. State Senator Leroy Comrie, representing District 14, voted for the initial PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement but pledged not to support future deals without federal funding and approvals. The plan faces criticism from watchdogs and officials like State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s office, who called for a delay due to limited financial details. Reinvent Albany slammed the process for lacking transparency and questioned the reliance on developer tax breaks. The redevelopment’s impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
