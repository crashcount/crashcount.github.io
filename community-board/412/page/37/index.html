DOT offers no timeline.</p><p class=mb3>On November 11, 2022, Councilmember Rita Joseph (District 40) issued a public letter to the Department of Transportation, demanding answers for the slow pace of speed hump installations. The matter, titled "#StuckAtDOT: It Takes Years (and Years) to Get a Speed Hump in this City," details Joseph’s frustration: 'In response to a speed hump request, my office was informed by the DOT that...studies are finalized after two years.' Joseph listed twelve locations needing speed humps; only one was approved, none installed. Eight were denied, several remain under review. Her district saw 1,173 crashes this year, injuring 87 cyclists and 141 pedestrians. Joseph, who lost students to traffic violence, calls the delay 'unacceptable.' DOT says it is reviewing her letter. Advocates demand faster action, saying, 'It should never take two years to implement these straight-forward safety measures.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Two front-seat passengers were injured: a 32-year-old man suffered abrasions to his lower leg and foot, and a 36-year-old man sustained a head contusion. Both remained conscious and were not ejected. The report lists aggressive driving and road rage as contributing factors. One driver was unlicensed and backing at the time of the crash. The injured passengers were not at fault. Safety equipment varied: one passenger wore a lap belt and harness, the other had none.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
