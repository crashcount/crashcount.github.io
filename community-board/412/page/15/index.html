The street swallows them and moves on.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> They killed four, left 12 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses injured dozens. Motorcycles and mopeds took lives and limbs.
