He wants justice for riders who walk, bike, and ride.</p><p class=mb3>On June 23, 2024, Council Member Justin Brannan (District 47) published an op-ed urging expansion of the Fair Fares program. The piece, titled 'Why expanding Fair Fares eligibility is a matter of racial equity,' highlights the push to raise eligibility from 120% to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. Brannan, chair of the Council’s Committee on Finance, argues, 'Expanding the eligibility for the City’s Fair Fares discounted-fare program to more low-income New Yorkers can begin to address this disparity.' He points out that subway and bus riders, mostly people of color and low-income workers, get the least public subsidy. The op-ed calls for urgent investment in affordable transit, especially for outer-borough and underinvested communities. Brannan’s action centers the needs of those who rely on safe, accessible transit to move through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
