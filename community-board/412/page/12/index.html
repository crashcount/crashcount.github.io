Thirty-five left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 8,000 crashes since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The violence is steady. It does not pause for holidays or rain. It does not care about age. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>Just this spring, a baby boy was crushed between two SUVs on Linden Boulevard. A 45-year-old woman died crossing 111th Avenue, struck by a driver who did not see her. <strong>A 19-year-old was killed on his motorcycle at 90th Avenue and 188th Street.</strong> The city records the deaths. The families keep the grief.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> Four dead, 12 seriously hurt, hundreds more injured by these vehicles alone. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave bodies broken. Bikes are not blameless, but the numbers are small—one serious injury, no deaths. The street is a gauntlet, and the biggest machines win.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Nantasha Williams voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop cars from killing. She co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>better pedestrian lighting</a> and <a href=#citations>solar crosswalks</a>, but these remain stuck in committee. <strong>The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph now. It has not.</strong></p><p>The bills pile up. The deaths do too. &ldquo;It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>said the NYPD</a> after a BMW vaulted a median and left six people hurt. The city studies. The families wait.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not studies. The street will not wait.
