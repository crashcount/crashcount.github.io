Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the toll in Queens CB12 in the past year. These are not just numbers. They are people. A man, 62, crushed by an SUV on Linden Boulevard. A 19-year-old, thrown from his moped, killed on 90th Avenue. A woman, 45, struck crossing 111th Avenue on Christmas night. Each one gone. Each one leaves a hole.</p><p>Just last week, a 23-year-old man was run down on 101st Street and Liberty Boulevard. Police said, &ldquo;Sonalall approached the driver&rsquo;s side window and flashed what appeared to be a gun, startling the motorist to the point that he drove off, striking the menace&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/01/us-news/man-23-fatally-run-over-by-ex-girlfriends-new-beau-in-love-triangle-clash-on-nyc-street-cops/>New York Post</a>). The DA filed no charges. The street is quiet again. The loss remains.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h2><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, 21 people died, 44 were seriously hurt, and over 5,300 were injured in 8,848 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). SUVs and sedans did most of the killing. Young men, old women, children—no one is spared. The dead are not just numbers. They are neighbors.</p><p>A mother’s words echo after her daughter’s death: &ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>Gothamist</a>).</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> Senator Leroy Comrie voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member Alicia Hyndman voted to extend school speed zones. But the carnage continues. There is no citywide 20 mph limit. There are no new safe crossings. There is no end to the waiting.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-waiting>The Cost of Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The streets do not forgive. The dead do not return. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. The law is on the books. The leaders have the phone lines. The families have the grief.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong> The time for waiting is over.

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pena tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, and had a blood-alcohol content of 0.156%. He faces 14 charges, including manslaughter and DWI.
