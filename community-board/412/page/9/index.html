The narrative states, 'His leg crushed beneath steel. He stayed awake. The pain spoke plainly: amputation.' The report lists 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors, explicitly citing driver error as central to the crash. The sedan was starting from parking, while the SUV was going straight ahead. The pedestrian suffered severe injury to his lower leg, resulting in amputation, but remained conscious throughout. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The impact and aftermath underscore the lethal consequences of driver inattention and obstructed views on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
