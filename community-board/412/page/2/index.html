Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, seven families have buried loved ones. Over 1,400 have been hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, sons, daughters. They are neighbors who never made it home.</p><p>On Linden Boulevard, a man with a cane tried to cross the street. A car hit him. Another ran him over. His family said, <strong>&ldquo;Today is a sad day. We lost a brother, father, son, uncle, and cousin. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/30/man-62-killed-in-front-of-his-queens-home-by-hit-and-run-driver-second-motorist/>He has been snuffed from us by a hit and runner driver.</a>&rdquo;</strong></p><p>A few months earlier, a driver lost control on 90th Avenue. The crash crushed a garage and a life. <strong>&ldquo;That is a big loss for us,&rdquo;</strong> his cousin <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/01/22/uber-driver-died-queens-crash-worked-nights-spend-days-kids/>said</a>. <strong>&ldquo;He was a caregiver. That&rsquo;s very, very tough for us.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-pattern-wide-roads-fast-cars-no-escape>The Pattern: Wide Roads, Fast Cars, No Escape</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In the last twelve months, cars and trucks took seven lives and left thirteen with serious injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are wide. The speeds are high. The crossings are long. The danger is constant.</p><h3 id=the-response-promises-delays-and-the-need-for-action>The Response: Promises, Delays, and the Need for Action</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in Queens CB12, the blood keeps flowing. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. Speed cameras save lives, but their future is always in doubt. <strong>Each day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand street redesigns that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No change for street safety.</p><p class=mb3>On June 2, 2025, City & State NY published an opinion urging action on Ryder’s Law, the stalled NYC Council bill to ban horse-drawn carriages. The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver. Despite the vivid danger, the safety analyst notes: "The event text does not describe any policy or legislative change affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so there is no direct impact on their safety." The bill remains stalled in committee, with no relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars keep two lanes. Buses lose out. Cyclists get nothing. Sidewalks widen, but most space stays with traffic. Critics say safety for walkers and riders is left behind.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city's announcement of a $550 million redesign for Fifth Avenue. The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
