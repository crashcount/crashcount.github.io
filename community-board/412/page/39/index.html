Seven in the last year. The numbers do not flinch. In the past twelve months, 1,448 people have been hurt in crashes here. Fourteen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk right again.</p><p>A 62-year-old man was killed crossing Linden Boulevard in April. The police report cites &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction.&rdquo; He died in the street, not at an intersection, hit by an SUV going straight ahead. No one else died that day, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Christmas night, a woman was killed at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. She was crossing—no signal, no crosswalk. The SUV kept going straight. She did not get up, as reported by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-delay>The Toll of Delay</h3><p>The city talks about safety. The bodies keep coming.</p><p>Council Member Nantasha Williams has voted for daylighting, traffic calming near seniors, and a greenway plan. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting and safer street design. But some bills remain <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>&ldquo;laid over in committee&rdquo;</a>, promises waiting in the dark.</p><p>The council voted to end jaywalking enforcement. Streets are for people, not just cars. As the council stated, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>&ldquo;The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But speed humps and real change come slow. As one advocate put it, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/11/stuckatdot-it-takes-years-and-years-to-get-a-speed-hump-in-this-city/#new_tab>&ldquo;It should never take two years to implement these straight-forward safety measures.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. Of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, cars and SUVs are the main weapon. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds leave their mark too, but the numbers are smaller. The dead are old and young, crossing at corners or not, walking home or just walking.</p><p>The city says it is acting. The street says otherwise. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract. It is a body in the road, a family waiting for news, a name that will not be spoken again.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not studies. Demand action before another name is lost.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
