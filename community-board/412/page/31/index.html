Thirty-four suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p><strong>Just last week, on June 26, 2025, Shaun Lagredelle was killed.</strong> He was riding a scooter west on 116th Avenue. A van turned left. Lagredelle was thrown from the scooter and died at the hospital. There were no arrests. The investigation drags on. Police <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>said</a>, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device.&rdquo;</p><p>Two days earlier, two moped riders collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. The street is unforgiving. The <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>NYPD said</a>, &ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-vulnerable>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed four pedestrians and left hundreds more injured. Trucks and buses injured dozens. Motorcycles and mopeds brought more pain, but the biggest threat rolls on four wheels. The young are not spared. In the last year, 143 people under 18 were hurt. Three people aged 18–24 died.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Council Member Nantasha Williams co-sponsored bills for better lighting and safer crossings. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the victim and not the driver. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p><strong>The law now says pedestrians can cross where they need to.</strong> But the cars keep coming. The city studies, debates, delays. The dead wait for nothing.</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-real-change>Act Now: Demand Real Change</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings, daylighted corners, and real enforcement against reckless drivers. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
