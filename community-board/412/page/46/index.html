Thirty-five more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been over 8,100 crashes and nearly 5,000 injuries. The bodies pile up. The pain does not fade. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Just last week, two people riding a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. No charges. No answers. The street stays the same. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>CBS New York</a></p><p>On June 26, a man named Shaun Lagredelle rode his scooter down 116th Avenue. A van turned left. He was thrown from the scooter. He died at the hospital. The city called for a pause on e-scooter share. The street did not change. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>AMNY</a></p><p>A few months back, a 45-year-old woman was crossing at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. An SUV hit her. She died. The driver kept going straight. The city kept going too.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have passed laws. Some help. Some stall.</strong> Council Member Nantasha Williams co-sponsored a bill to create a task force on e-bike street safety. The bill sits in committee. The task force does not exist. The danger does.</p><p>Williams also co-sponsored a bill to boost pedestrian lighting. That bill is stalled too. The streets stay dark.</p><p>But there is movement. The Council voted to legalize jaywalking. Now, crossing the street is not a crime. Streets are for people, not just cars. The <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</a></p><p>The city has started to lower speed limits in some places. But not everywhere. Not fast enough. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/20/dot-bringing-more-20-mile-per-hour-speed-limits-to-neighborhoods-around-the-city>&ldquo;The number of lives lost to traffic violence is simply unacceptable,&rdquo;</a> said Council Member Erik Bottcher.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted corners. Demand action, not studies. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city’s most vulnerable stay in the crosshairs.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2022, State Senator Leroy Comrie made a public statement on congestion pricing exemptions. The matter, covered by nypost.com, centers on calls from Mayor Eric Adams for more exemptions to the Manhattan congestion tolls. Adams argued, 'there should be a level of exemptions... so that we’re not overburdening New Yorkers.' But Comrie rejected this, stating, 'I don’t think there should be any exemptions, and I’m going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' The congestion pricing plan, passed in 2019, already exempts emergency vehicles, vehicles carrying disabled New Yorkers, and low-income residents inside the zone. Comrie’s stance keeps the system strict. No new carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board may still consider more, but Comrie’s position is clear: every driver pays the toll, no exceptions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A driver with nine speeding and three red light tickets struck a pedestrian in Park Slope on June 17, 2022. Despite this record, the driver faced no license consequences. A state bill to expand speed camera hours originally included escalating fines for repeat offenders, but Council leaders refused to approve that provision. Other bills to count camera tickets toward license penalties also failed due to lack of Council support. Assembly Member Bill Magnarelli supported cameras and future escalating fines, while Council Speaker Adrienne Adams declined comment. The matter highlights a system where, as one witness said, 'government chooses not to hold drivers accountable.' The city’s refusal to act leaves reckless drivers on the road and vulnerable users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates call it a step, not a leap. The mayor and speaker skipped safety talk. Streets still wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2022, the City Council and Mayor Adams reached a budget agreement, allocating $53 million in operating funds for the Department of Transportation for the fiscal year starting July 1. This is a down payment on the mayor's promised $904 million for the Streets Master Plan, but falls short of the Council's $3.1 billion ask to double the plan's targets. The plan mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes, 150 miles of dedicated bus lanes, and new public plazas. The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, did not comment. Advocates praised the funding as a significant step, but stressed the need for strong implementation to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
