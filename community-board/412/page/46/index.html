The measure urges passage of S.4037/A.5896, which would 'extend and expand the scope of the MTA On-Demand E-Hail Paratransit Pilot Program.' Council Member Justin L. Brannan led sponsorship, joined by Ayala, Menin, Louis, Hanif, Hudson, Bottcher, Farías, Brooks-Powers, and Brewer. The resolution slams service caps and fare surcharges, calling them 'inequitable and unjust.' It demands that paratransit users get the same fare, hours, and ride freedom as subway and bus riders. The bill would end rationing and financial barriers for disabled New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride.

New laws hit drivers who hide plates or fake exemptions. The MTA loses millions to evasion. Lawmakers debate fairness and credits. Enforcement sharpens. Revenue for transit hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bill 42, part of Governor Hochul’s 2022 executive budget, aims to enforce congestion pricing by introducing new penalties for toll evasion. The proposal, discussed in the Senate on January 20, 2022, lets the DMV deny registration to vehicles with unpaid tolls and sets fines up to $5,000 for fraudulent exemption claims. The matter summary states: 'Governor Kathy Hochul's executive budget includes several changes to New York's congestion pricing program, which is expected to provide crucial revenue for transit upgrades.' Senator James Skoufis, mentioned in the hearing, pushed for credits for certain drivers. The bill is supported by MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick and Governor Hochul’s office, who say it will ensure fairness. The MTA reports $4 million lost annually to toll evaders. The review board will finalize fee structures and exemptions. No specific safety impact for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Leroy Comrie, chair of the MTA committee, spoke at a legislative hearing on congestion pricing exemptions. The hearing addressed whether to grant more carve-outs to Manhattan’s congestion tolls. Comrie declared, 'I don't think there should be any exemptions, and I'm going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' He pushed back against senators seeking discounts for suburban drivers and city workers. Comrie warned that opening the door to more exemptions would undermine the law’s intent and threaten revenue for transit.
