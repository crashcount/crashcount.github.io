The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On September 7, 2023, QueensLink supporters rallied at City Hall, pushing for the reactivation of an old rail line between southeast and central Queens. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the proposal's promise: 'both new train service and park land.' State Sen. James Sanders led the call, declaring, 'Yes, we want a park and yes we want a light rail. We can have both.' Mike Scala, another advocate, stressed public support for a combined approach. The QueensLink faces competition from the QueensWay, a park-only plan with $35 million in city funding. The MTA has not committed, citing high costs and ongoing needs assessment. No formal council bill or committee action is recorded yet. Supporters remain determined to see transit, park space, and bike paths included in future city plans.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
