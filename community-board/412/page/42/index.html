Thirty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> Five thousand more hurt since 2022. The wounds are not abstract. They are broken bones, crushed bodies, and families who will never be whole again.</p><p>Just this spring, a 62-year-old man was killed on Linden Boulevard. He was crossing. Two cars, an SUV and a sedan, struck him. He died there, on the street, not at an intersection, not in a crosswalk. The cause: driver inattention. The record says only &ldquo;crush injuries&rdquo; and &ldquo;semiconscious&rdquo; before death. No arrest. No comfort. Only silence (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 19-year-old on a moped died on 90th Avenue. Ejected. Apparent death. Helmet or not, it did not matter. The SUV kept going straight. The moped was demolished (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> In three years, they killed five, seriously injured twelve, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses injured dozens. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave bodies in the street. Bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The pattern is clear: the bigger the machine, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=words-from-the-wreckage>Words from the Wreckage</h3><p>After a crane slammed into a city bus in Queens Village, a survivor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>recalled</a>, <strong>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us. I was holding on for my life back there&rdquo;</strong>.</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a BMW went airborne. Passengers were thrown from the car.

She co-sponsored a bill to bring more light to dark corridors, but it sits stalled in committee. She backed a task force to study e-bike street safety, but the city is still waiting for action. <strong>Bills to protect the most vulnerable are too often delayed, studied, or ignored.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another body in the street.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just studies. Tell them: the dead cannot wait.

Critics warn of secrecy and developer giveaways.</p><p class=mb3>On July 27, 2022, the state’s Public Authorities Control Board approved Governor Kathy Hochul’s Penn Station redevelopment plan. The project, described as a 'once-in-a-generation opportunity,' includes 18 million square feet of new office towers, 1,800 apartments, a $7 billion station upgrade, and promises of walkable streets and bike lanes. State Senator Leroy Comrie, representing District 14, voted for the initial PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement but pledged not to support future deals without federal funding and approvals. The plan faces criticism from watchdogs and officials like State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s office, who called for a delay due to limited financial details. Reinvent Albany slammed the process for lacking transparency and questioned the reliance on developer tax breaks. The redevelopment’s impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Leroy Comrie drew a hard line. No exemptions for Manhattan’s congestion tolls. He stood firm as others called for carve-outs. His stance means every car pays. No relief for drivers. The city’s most vulnerable stay in the crosshairs.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2022, State Senator Leroy Comrie made a public statement on congestion pricing exemptions. The matter, covered by nypost.com, centers on calls from Mayor Eric Adams for more exemptions to the Manhattan congestion tolls. Adams argued, 'there should be a level of exemptions... so that we’re not overburdening New Yorkers.' But Comrie rejected this, stating, 'I don’t think there should be any exemptions, and I’m going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' The congestion pricing plan, passed in 2019, already exempts emergency vehicles, vehicles carrying disabled New Yorkers, and low-income residents inside the zone. Comrie’s stance keeps the system strict. No new carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board may still consider more, but Comrie’s position is clear: every driver pays the toll, no exceptions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
