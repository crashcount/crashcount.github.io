He survived. Many do not. In the last twelve months, 258 people died on New York City streets. 732 suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, and everyone in between. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><p>A 95-year-old woman, Mayya Gil, was killed crossing Cropsey Avenue. She survived the Nazis and Chernobyl. She did not survive a Brooklyn van. The driver was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. &ldquo;Police have arrested a man they say struck and killed a beloved 95-year-old Brooklyn woman with a cargo van as she crossed the street near her home,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-man-arrested-in-fatal-crash-with-pedestrian-95-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>Over 51,000 people were injured in the last year. Children under 18 made up 11 deaths and more than 4,200 injuries. The old are not spared. People 75 and older: 20 dead, 697 injured. The city’s streets are a gauntlet. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—311 deaths in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 95. Motorcycles and mopeds, 10. Bikes, 11. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city has taken steps. Speed limits are dropping in some zones. Speed cameras are here to stay. But the pace is slow. &ldquo;The 32 percent drop in traffic fatalities that we have seen this year is historic… further proof that our Vision Zero efforts are working,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,on%20and%20off%20our%20streets">said Mayor Adams</a>. But the work is not done. Every day of delay is another day of risk.

This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Join forces with groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Every day you wait, someone else pays the price.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.

Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The e-biker hit it, thrown into the street. A truck rolled over him. He died in the gutter, Broome and Centre. The city lost a musician. The street stayed the same.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 3, 2025, that George Smaragdis, known as synthwave artist Starcadian, died after being doored by a Mercedes van while riding his e-bike westbound on Broome Street in Manhattan. The impact threw him into the path of a red delivery truck, which ran him over. Police said Smaragdis suffered severe head trauma and died at Bellevue Hospital. The article notes, 'The man who died after being doored while riding an e-bike and then run over by a passing truck...was a popular and influential synthwave artist.' The crash highlights the ongoing danger of dooring and the lethal consequences when street design and driver actions fail to protect cyclists. No mention of charges or policy changes followed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
