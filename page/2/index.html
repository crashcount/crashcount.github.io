A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted corners. Demand action, not words. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is policy.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, which failed to pass this session, would require drivers with six speeding tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The matter, titled 'In His Own Words: Albany Dysfunction Through The Eyes of One Road Violence Victim,' centers on Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost his daughter to traffic violence. Sealy-McCrorey, backed by Families for Safe Streets, lobbied lawmakers and voiced his frustration: 'If Stop Super Speeders had been passed before, it could have saved my daughter's life.' Despite his efforts, Albany did not act. The safety analyst notes that this event describes tragedy and disappointment, but no policy change or legislative action affecting pedestrian or cyclist safety occurred.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety denied.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2025, Amy Cohen, president of Families for Safe Streets, issued a public statement condemning Mayor Adams for invoking Sammy’s Law to justify citywide 15 mph speed limits for e-bikes. Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed by a reckless driver, said, 'Sammy’s Law has never been intended to be used in this way.' She criticized the administration for failing to lower speed limits for cars—the main source of traffic deaths and injuries. Cohen supports safe e-bike speeds but insists regulation should happen at the point of sale, not through police enforcement. The safety analyst notes this move undermines established safe streets efforts, likely reducing protections for pedestrians and cyclists and discouraging mode shift and street equity. No council bill or committee action is attached; this is a forceful advocacy statement, not legislation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented by DOT Director Chris Brunson to the Brooklyn Community Board 2 Transportation Committee, removes a travel lane and 59 parking spots to add a protected bike lane, pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and commercial loading zones. The committee supported the plan with five votes in favor, three abstentions, and none opposed. The DOT aims to install the lane this summer, pending further presentations. Brunson called the redesign 'essential for fixing Court Street, a pedestrian and cyclist-heavy street dominated by vehicle infrastructure.' Safety analysts note that road diets like this reduce vehicle speeds, shorten crossing distances, and create space for bike lanes or wider sidewalks, improving safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists at the population level. Council member Dave Colon supports the move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists would treat red lights as stop signs, stop signs as yields. The change cuts needless stops, reduces police targeting, and matches law to street reality. Safety improves for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2025, Neile Weissman issued a public statement backing the Stop as Yield (SAY) bill—also known as the Idaho Stop—for cyclists in New York. The proposal, now before the State Legislature, would 'let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs, and stop signs as yields.' Weissman’s statement, published in Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to end overzealous enforcement and racial targeting of cyclists. He writes, 'SAY would make roads safer for cyclists, safer for pedestrians and, by spurring transition to sustainable modes of travel, better for the planet.' The bill is not yet law and has no listed committee or vote. Weissman’s advocacy draws on safety data: allowing cyclists to yield at stop signs and proceed on red reduces time spent in intersections, cuts crash risk, and encourages cycling. States like Idaho have seen no rise in cyclist injuries after similar laws. The measure aligns law with how cyclists ride and protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Jessica Tisch claimed police focus on six reckless offenses along 14 corridors. Duggan's reporting, published by Streetsblog NYC, reveals a much broader and harsher crackdown. Cyclists and e-bike riders, many of them immigrant workers, face tickets for minor or unclear infractions. Community boards and elected officials oppose the crackdown. Duggan quotes riders who say police create hazards and confusion, sometimes standing in bike lanes or ticketing for actions not on the official list.

The matter: 'the proposed redesign of the Hudson River Greenway seize adjacent space currently devoted to cars in order to widen the crowded bike and pedestrian path.' Christine Berthet, co-chair of CB4's Transportation Planning Committee, said, '[Taking some space from cars] to give space to pedestrians and bikes is necessary.'
