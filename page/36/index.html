In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The campaign supports a stronger pedestrian safety rating system, automatic emergency braking that detects all road users, and side underride guards for trucks. It opposes the current NHTSA proposals, which allow dangerous vehicles to pass with top ratings and exclude cyclists from detection requirements.

The city’s timid plan leaves lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published July 5, 2023, urges the city to go beyond the current Crosstown Bike Lane proposal. The piece highlights the lack of east-west protected bike lanes between 55th and 158th streets, except for two blocks. It quotes: 'A proposal for crosstown bike paths on the Upper West and East sides has potential to close that gap—but should go further by significantly reducing the presence of cars on the arterial transverses cutting across Central Park.' The author criticizes Community Boards 7 and 8 for only requesting lanes every ten blocks, calling this inadequate. The editorial calls for more frequent, concrete-protected bike lanes, expanded pedestrian space, and bus lanes. It demands car bans on select park transverses, citing the death of Carling Mott and widespread resident dissatisfaction. The call is clear: timid measures leave vulnerable road users exposed. Only bold action will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her ‘Street Code’ puts pedestrians first. Sidewalks widen. Parking vanishes. School streets grow. SUVs face higher fees. E-bikes stay. Cars lose ground. Advocates urge New York to follow Paris’s bold lead.</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2023, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced a sweeping policy shift, introducing a new 'Street Code' that gives 'absolute priority for pedestrians.' The plan, detailed in committee and public remarks, promises to eliminate 70,000 surface parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, and create 300 school streets. Hidalgo declared, 'We must protect pedestrians first.' The policy bans shared e-scooters but keeps private ones legal, expands bike infrastructure, and introduces progressive parking fees for SUVs. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives contrasted Paris’s action with New York’s inaction, noting, 'The number one danger to pedestrians is cars and trucks.' Advocates say Paris’s approach—shrinking car space, not blaming micromobility—shows how cities can save lives by putting vulnerable road users first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
