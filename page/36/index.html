The driver, unbelted, lost control on slick pavement. Metal twisted, glass burst. Thrown from the wreck, his head struck hard. Alone, he died on the frozen asphalt.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a BMW SUV traveling eastbound on Belt Parkway crashed while moving at unsafe speed on slippery pavement. The sole occupant, a 41-year-old male driver, was ejected from the vehicle and killed, suffering fatal head injuries. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Pavement Slippery' as contributing factors. The SUV was described as 'demolished' at the point of impact. The driver was not wearing a seatbelt, but the police report attributes the crash primarily to excessive speed and hazardous road conditions. No other vehicles or road users were involved. The narrative underscores the violence of the crash and the systemic danger posed by high speeds, especially under adverse conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.
