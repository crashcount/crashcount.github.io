His son stands over him, waiting for his eyes to open. They never do. Just days ago, Pasqual Tziquin was killed crossing New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. The driver did not stop. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. Eight days later, Pasqual was dead. His family waits for justice.</p><p>Across the city, the violence does not let up. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW vaulted the median and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;speed may have been an issue&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>in the crash</a>. In Crown Heights, an eight-year-old boy was struck and killed by an SUV. The street is a main road, built for speed. The boy is gone.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p>In the last twelve months, 236 people have died on New York City streets. Another 704 suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do the most harm: SUVs and cars killed 300 people, seriously injured 509, and hurt over 26,000 more in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders move. The city has started to lower speed limits, install more speed cameras, and build protected bike lanes. But too often, safety is ripped out as fast as it is built. When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue bike lane, the Department of Transportation warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.</p><p>Others push policies that punish the vulnerable. A 15 mph e-bike speed cap is on the table. Michael Replogle, former DOT official, calls it &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>said Replogle</a>. The city debates, the streets bleed.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not rip them out. Tell them to stop blaming the people on foot and on bikes. The bodies in the street are not statistics. They are your neighbors. They are your children. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

City Hall has stalled.</p><p class=mb3>On March 18, 2025, leaders of Manhattan Community Boards 4, 5, and 6 sent a letter to Mayor Adams and the Department of Transportation. The letter urges the city to deliver a long-promised busway along the full length of 34th Street. The boards request widened sidewalks, bus stop bulb-outs, and dedicated loading and pickup/drop off zones. They write, 'this project would significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 34th Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' The boards cite the 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24 percent and ridership by 30 percent. Council members are not named, but the boards’ action is clear: they support the busway and pedestrian improvements. The letter calls these changes 'necessary and forward-thinking' for safety and congestion. Mayor Adams has lagged on bus lanes, painting just 5 miles per year, far below the City Council’s 30-mile goal. DOT says a proposal is coming.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states she was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk. The impact killed her instantly, leaving her body in the roadway.

The memo, citing Trump-era executive orders, targets projects advancing climate, equity, and safety goals. The review flags any project with equity analysis, green infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure, or EV charging for possible removal. Projects with fully obligated funds are exempt. Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) condemned the move, saying it 'ignores Congress and the law by slashing grants for bike and pedestrian infrastructure and EV charging.' Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) warned, 'Pedestrians and cyclists are going to die.' The League of American Bicyclists said the freeze will hurt communities and halt safety investments. Highway projects remain untouched.

The event, organized by Make McGuinness Safe, follows the Adams administration's rollback of the original plan after political lobbying. Lander declared, "With street safety, City Hall and DOT are supposed to make the assessment: 'Will this project make things safer?' And if so, go ahead and do it." He criticized the current system as a 'corruption obstacle,' promising to implement the full road diet and streamline safety approvals. Lander's pledge centers community voices and rejects interference from wealthy donors. He invoked DOT data showing that redesigns save lives for all users.

Six points in 15 months could mean suspension; ten could mean revocation. The matter summary states, 'rules promise to increase safety for passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists alike [and] target a relatively small group of repeat offenders.' TLC spokesperson Jason Kersten said the changes target repeat offenders who make streets dangerous.

At a press conference, Hochul declared, 'We are not subservient to a king or anyone else out of Washington.' She promised the tolling cameras would remain active unless the MTA lost its legal battle. MTA CEO Janno Lieber reported, 'Speeds are up, up, up. The streets are safer. Half as many crashes. And that means pedestrians are not getting injured and killed.' Advocates like Brent Bovenzi and Christopher Sanders praised Hochul’s strong stance and noted the program’s success. The statement signals Hochul’s commitment to safer, less congested streets and resistance to federal interference.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected bike lane. Injuries fell. Pedestrians, cyclists, passengers safer. No deaths since redesign. Bike traffic soared. DOT says green wave slows cars, helps walkers, riders. Streets once deadly now less so. Numbers show lives saved.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the city Department of Transportation (DOT) released new safety data for Third Avenue in Manhattan. The protected bike lane and street redesign, finished in late 2023 from East 59th to East 96th streets, cut total injuries by 33 percent. Pedestrian injuries dropped 63 percent. Cyclist injuries fell 10 percent, even as bike traffic jumped 79 percent. No pedestrians or cyclists have died since the changes. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT's redesign of Third Avenue has significantly reduced serious injuries—whether you're walking, biking, or in a car on the corridor." The DOT also highlighted its 'green wave' signal timing, set to 15 mph, which slows drivers and helps vulnerable users. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called Third Avenue "one of the best streets in all of New York City" and urged similar redesigns elsewhere. The city estimates protected bike lanes cut deaths and serious injuries by 18.1 percent for all, and 29.2 percent for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The feds yanked approval. The MTA sued. Transit funding took a hit. Streets stay clogged. Pedestrians and cyclists lose. The city’s lifeline is at risk. Politicians bicker. The danger remains. The fight moves to court.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration revoked federal approval for New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The move, announced by U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, argued the program’s main goal was revenue, not congestion relief. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit, calling the action unlawful. The bill is not a council measure but a federal policy reversal, with local officials and advocates condemning the decision. State Senator Zellnor Myrie was mentioned among those opposing the move. The matter title reads: 'Trump Withdraws Federal Approval for Congestion Pricing, Blowing Hole in Transit Budget, as MTA Files Lawsuit.' The reversal threatens transit funding and leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing traffic danger. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the loss of congestion pricing means more cars, more risk, and less money for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states, 'A 67-year-old man on a bike hit the door of a parked SUV. No helmet. His head struck hard. He flew, then fell. Blood spread. The SUV was untouched. He died.' The police report lists no specific driver errors or contributing factors, marking them as 'Unspecified.' The SUV was parked, and the cyclist was ejected upon impact, suffering fatal head injuries. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but does not cite this as a contributing factor to the crash. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between vulnerable road users and parked vehicles in Manhattan’s dense streetscape.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
