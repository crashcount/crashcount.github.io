When police arrived, the suspects "accelerated toward the cops, nearly striking them," prompting an officer to fire. No injuries were reported, but the suspects fled at high speed. Officers were treated for ear ringing at a hospital. Two suspects were later detained and four BMWs recovered. The incident highlights the risk posed by fleeing drivers who use vehicles as weapons. No charges were immediately filed. The event underscores the persistent threat to bystanders and first responders when cars are used recklessly in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jennifer Noble, one of the riders, described, "I caught it with my hand. I tried to prevent it from moving, but it cut through my fingers and then my forehead." Her friend suffered a serious throat injury and was hospitalized. Police confirmed both injuries and are investigating. The article notes the string may have come from kite fighting, a practice known for using sharp or glass-coated lines. Previous incidents involving invisible kite strings on bike paths have been documented. The event exposes a systemic hazard for cyclists, raising questions about oversight and public safety on city bridges.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
