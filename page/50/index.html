Children, elders, cyclists, and workers are struck down in the crosswalk, on the sidewalk, waiting for the light. The city keeps moving. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><p>Just days ago, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV in Crown Heights. The street was wide, the car was heavy, the child was small. The city called it another tragedy. Advocates called it what it is: a failure. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Eastern Parkway acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>, said one group, demanding more safety infrastructure to stop the killing.</p><h2 id=policy-progress-and-sabotage>Policy: Progress and Sabotage</h2><p><strong>Some leaders move.

Still, the city tries to erase protection for the most vulnerable. On Review Avenue, a new protected bike lane opened after years of struggle. Cyclists now have a sliver of safety. &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous,&rdquo; said a daily rider. The new path is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>definitely safer because he no longer fights trucks for space</a>.</p><p>But for every step forward, another is lost. The mayor removes bike lanes. The council debates. Children die. The city counts bodies.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, they have caused 301 deaths and over 26,000 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is preventable. The city has the power to lower speed limits, build real protection, and stop repeat offenders. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected lanes. Demand enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers, not cyclists or children.</strong></p><p>The city will not save you. Only your voice, raised with others, can force their hand.

The 37-year-old motorcycle rider was ejected and killed, suffering fatal head injuries. According to the police report, 'A sedan struck a motorcycle head-on. The unlicensed rider, 37, wore no helmet. He flew from the bike, landed headfirst on the pavement, and died beneath a gray Queens sky.' The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor. The sedan driver was licensed and traveling north; the motorcycle was heading east. The rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause cited is the sedan driver's failure to yield.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan targets drivers who endanger parents, wheelchair users, and cyclists. NYPD resists, warning of conflict. Streets remain hazardous. Action demanded.</p><p class=mb3>On October 10, 2022, Councilman Lincoln Restler (District 33) introduced a bill to the New York City Council. The measure, now under committee review, proposes a civilian reporting and reward program for illegal parking enforcement. The bill summary states: 'New York City is considering a policy that would pay people up to $44 for each actionable tip about cars illegally blocking bike lanes and intersections.' Restler, the sole sponsor, said, 'Too many parents with strollers, people in wheelchairs and bicyclists face unsafe conditions every day because of sidewalks and bike lanes obstructed by illegal parking.' The bill would empower the Department of Transportation to enlist civilians to flag violators, with a 25% share of fines as reward. The NYPD opposes the plan, warning it could pit neighbor against neighbor and outsource risk to civilians. The bill aims to protect vulnerable road users by targeting hazardous obstructions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
