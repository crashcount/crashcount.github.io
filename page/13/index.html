His son stands over him, waiting for his eyes to open. They never do. Just days ago, Pasqual Tziquin was killed crossing New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. The driver did not stop. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. Eight days later, Pasqual was dead. His family waits for justice.</p><p>Across the city, the violence does not let up. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW vaulted the median and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;speed may have been an issue&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>in the crash</a>. In Crown Heights, an eight-year-old boy was struck and killed by an SUV. The street is a main road, built for speed. The boy is gone.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p>In the last twelve months, 236 people have died on New York City streets. Another 704 suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do the most harm: SUVs and cars killed 300 people, seriously injured 509, and hurt over 26,000 more in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders move. The city has started to lower speed limits, install more speed cameras, and build protected bike lanes. But too often, safety is ripped out as fast as it is built. When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue bike lane, the Department of Transportation warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.</p><p>Others push policies that punish the vulnerable. A 15 mph e-bike speed cap is on the table. Michael Replogle, former DOT official, calls it &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>said Replogle</a>. The city debates, the streets bleed.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not rip them out. Tell them to stop blaming the people on foot and on bikes. The bodies in the street are not statistics. They are your neighbors. They are your children. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

At a Prospect Park West event, Gary Eckstein, father of crash victim Sammy Cohen-Eckstein, marked 11 years since his son's death. He declared, 'A mistake by a driver or someone walking or biking should not be a death sentence.' Eckstein urged the city to expand 20 mph limits, saying, 'Many more lives can be saved and communities enriched.' Politicians credited advocates for the change. The event highlighted the urgent need for lower speeds to protect pedestrians and cyclists. No council bill number or committee was cited, but the advocacy targets citywide policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A 26-year-old man was thrown from his motorcycle. He hit headfirst. The front end crumpled. The road stayed hard. He did not get up.' The impact was severe, with the motorcycle sustaining center front-end damage and the rider suffering fatal head injuries. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' providing no further detail on the cause. The victim was ejected from the motorcycle and killed instantly, with apparent death noted at the scene. No other vehicles or persons were involved, and the report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of high-speed impacts and the unforgiving nature of city expressways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Seniors and advocates demand action. The city drags its feet. Pedestrians choke on fumes, dodge cars, trip on broken sidewalks. Most don’t own cars. Most walk. Still, cars rule the street. The danger remains. The city studies. People die.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy campaign, highlighted on October 4, 2024, calls for a full redesign of Canal Street. Manhattan Community Board 1, Transportation Alternatives, and local seniors demand urgent action. The matter: 'transforming Canal Street into a safer, more accessible space for everyone, especially seniors.' Emily Jacobi of Transportation Alternatives says, 'Canal is dangerous, it's deadly, and it's killing us.' Wellington Chen of the Chinatown Partnership points to pollution and stress harming elders. The Department of Transportation claims improvements are coming, but progress is slow. Community Board 1 voted for expanded pedestrian space and a protected bike lane years ago. Most residents walk or use transit. Still, the street favors cars. Since 2014, Canal has seen 10 deaths and 700 injuries. The city’s inaction leaves seniors and all vulnerable users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece does not reference a council bill, but it issues a sharp rebuke to politicians who fixate on moped riders while ignoring the main threat. The editorial states, 'Virtually all of the injuries and deaths on our roadways are caused by the drivers of cars and trucks.' The video, created by Streetsblog Engagement Editor, shows graphic evidence of this violence. The editorial calls for road safety redesigns that protect the most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, seniors, children, people in wheelchairs. It demands accountability from car and truck drivers, not scapegoating of two-wheelers. The message is blunt: the crisis is behind the wheel, not on the sidewalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed with Community Board 2’s Transportation Committee, removes one of four car lanes to install a curbside protected bike lane between Lispenard and W. Eighth streets. DOT project manager Preston Johnson called it 'the last gap between the Financial District and Central Park.' The plan forces cyclists to switch sides twice to accommodate Holland Tunnel traffic and firehouse parking. Over five years, 469 crashes injured 187 people on this stretch. Community Board 2 Transportation Chair Shirley Secunda said, 'Eight years ago we did a resolution asking DOT to reduce Sixth Avenue to three travel lanes from four [so] we’re very happy that it’s finally happening.' The project adds eight-to-ten-foot bike lanes, pedestrianizes a slip lane, and builds bus boarding islands.

Jon Orcutt, former DOT official, calls for targeted enforcement against drivers, especially those dodging accountability. DOT spokesman Vin Barone says, 'Cars are heavier and faster and still pose a far greater risk.' The Adams administration is expanding pedestrian plazas, daylighting intersections, and cracking down on reckless driving. Data show cars and trucks cause most deaths, not micromobility. Only 5.5% of injuries involve e-bikes or mopeds. The city focuses on driver accountability and infrastructure, but the toll climbs.
