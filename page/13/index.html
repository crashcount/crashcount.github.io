An SUV hit him at the corner of Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. He was eight. The street is wide. The cars are fast. The city counts another child lost. Advocates <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>describe Eastern Parkway as a major thoroughfare for drivers and the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>. The numbers do not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>238 people have died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>705 were seriously injured</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers—the city’s most vulnerable, crushed by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the current three-year period, they killed <strong>300 people</strong> and seriously injured <strong>509</strong> more. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong> and seriously injured <strong>103</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed <strong>10</strong> and seriously injured <strong>44</strong>. Bikes killed <strong>11</strong> and seriously injured <strong>54</strong>. The dead do not care about the make or model. They are gone all the same. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>. The violence is not random. It is built into the street.</p><h3 id=leaders-actor-dont>Leaders Act—Or Don’t</h3><p><strong>Some leaders move. Some stall. Some rip out what little safety we have.</strong> When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, the Department of Transportation <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>warned that removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe</a>. The city risks legal liability for knowingly making a Vision Zero corridor more dangerous. Cyclists and parents begged to keep the lane. One parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/cyclists-tell-judge-carolyn-walker-diallo-the-bedford-ave-bike-lane-is-a-lifesaver>explained, &ldquo;Before the protected bike lane my wife made me promise to never bike the children on it because the driving behavior was so outrageous&mldr; Now the street is so much calmer.&rdquo;</a> Still, the fight drags on.</p><p>Elsewhere, the city installs new bike lanes, then threatens to cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. A former DOT official <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it &ldquo;a war on bikes, a war on immigrants, and it undermines traffic safety&rdquo;</a>. The city’s priorities shift with the wind. The bodies stay in the ground.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every rollback, every excuse is another name on a slab. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand streets where children can walk and live. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the pedestrian was 'crossing without a signal.' The truck, described as a 2018 KW-TRUCK/BUS, showed 'no damage' after the crash. The victim suffered fatal injuries to her entire body and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police list the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The report notes the truck's point of impact was the 'right front quarter panel.' The narrative describes the moment as one where 'her body bore the weight of steel, silence, and final breath.' No driver errors are explicitly cited in the data, and no victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors beyond the absence of a crossing signal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
