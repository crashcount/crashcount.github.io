In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The 21-year-old motorcyclist, who was wearing a helmet, was ejected from his seat and died at the scene. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors in the crash. The motorcyclist’s individual record also lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Turning Improperly' as factors. The SUV was turning left when the collision occurred, with the point of impact on its right side doors. The report describes the motorcycle as demolished and the rider suffering crush injuries to the entire body. The data highlights driver errors—failure to obey traffic controls and improper turning—as central to the deadly outcome.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

At a Prospect Park West event, Gary Eckstein, father of crash victim Sammy Cohen-Eckstein, marked 11 years since his son's death. He declared, 'A mistake by a driver or someone walking or biking should not be a death sentence.' Eckstein urged the city to expand 20 mph limits, saying, 'Many more lives can be saved and communities enriched.' Politicians credited advocates for the change. The event highlighted the urgent need for lower speeds to protect pedestrians and cyclists. No council bill number or committee was cited, but the advocacy targets citywide policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The danger remains. The city studies. People die.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy campaign, highlighted on October 4, 2024, calls for a full redesign of Canal Street. Manhattan Community Board 1, Transportation Alternatives, and local seniors demand urgent action. The matter: 'transforming Canal Street into a safer, more accessible space for everyone, especially seniors.' Emily Jacobi of Transportation Alternatives says, 'Canal is dangerous, it's deadly, and it's killing us.' Wellington Chen of the Chinatown Partnership points to pollution and stress harming elders. The Department of Transportation claims improvements are coming, but progress is slow. Community Board 1 voted for expanded pedestrian space and a protected bike lane years ago. Most residents walk or use transit. Still, the street favors cars. Since 2014, Canal has seen 10 deaths and 700 injuries. The city’s inaction leaves seniors and all vulnerable users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece does not reference a council bill, but it issues a sharp rebuke to politicians who fixate on moped riders while ignoring the main threat. The editorial states, 'Virtually all of the injuries and deaths on our roadways are caused by the drivers of cars and trucks.' The video, created by Streetsblog Engagement Editor, shows graphic evidence of this violence. The editorial calls for road safety redesigns that protect the most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, seniors, children, people in wheelchairs. It demands accountability from car and truck drivers, not scapegoating of two-wheelers. The message is blunt: the crisis is behind the wheel, not on the sidewalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed with Community Board 2’s Transportation Committee, removes one of four car lanes to install a curbside protected bike lane between Lispenard and W. Eighth streets. DOT project manager Preston Johnson called it 'the last gap between the Financial District and Central Park.' The plan forces cyclists to switch sides twice to accommodate Holland Tunnel traffic and firehouse parking. Over five years, 469 crashes injured 187 people on this stretch. Community Board 2 Transportation Chair Shirley Secunda said, 'Eight years ago we did a resolution asking DOT to reduce Sixth Avenue to three travel lanes from four [so] we’re very happy that it’s finally happening.' The project adds eight-to-ten-foot bike lanes, pedestrianizes a slip lane, and builds bus boarding islands.

Jon Orcutt, former DOT official, calls for targeted enforcement against drivers, especially those dodging accountability. DOT spokesman Vin Barone says, 'Cars are heavier and faster and still pose a far greater risk.' The Adams administration is expanding pedestrian plazas, daylighting intersections, and cracking down on reckless driving. Data show cars and trucks cause most deaths, not micromobility. Only 5.5% of injuries involve e-bikes or mopeds. The city focuses on driver accountability and infrastructure, but the toll climbs.
