An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers are among them (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city renewed its speed camera program. Governor Hochul said, <strong>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe. There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Still, the mayor ripped out the Bedford Avenue lane. Cyclists are left exposed. The city risks more deaths, more grief.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h3><p>SUVs and cars kill most. In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that leaders stop tearing out what little safety we have. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cyclists and walkers lose their only safe path. Detour runs through truck-choked streets. No barriers. No protection. Residents demand action. Parks Department faces criticism for neglecting vulnerable road users. Danger rises as closure begins.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2022, the Parks Department will close a one-mile stretch of the Hudson River Greenway between Dyckman Street and the George Washington Bridge for at least four months. The closure, announced in the opinion piece 'City Must Protect Bikers, Walkers During Hudson Greenway Closure,' leaves pedestrians and cyclists in Washington Heights, Inwood, and the Northwest Bronx without a safe north-south route. The city’s detour—via Dyckman Street, Broadway, and West 181st Street—forces vulnerable road users onto dangerous, truck-heavy roads. The author, echoing community demands, calls for immediate safety measures like physical barriers and criticizes the Parks Department for closing vital bike corridors without proper oversight. Previous requests for a protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway and federal funding for greenway improvements were ignored. The piece urges the city to act now to protect non-vehicular road users during the closure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article highlights Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s move to seek public input on the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which rates new cars for safety. The matter title calls for the government to 'require safer vehicles by updating Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.' Mike McGinn, executive director of America Walks, leads the advocacy. The piece slams current safety ratings as 'almost worthless' and points to the deadly impact of larger vehicles. It notes that SUVs and pickups are two to three times more likely to kill pedestrians than passenger cars. Advocates urge NHTSA to act now, demanding that vehicle design finally center the safety of those outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
