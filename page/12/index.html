In the last twelve months, <strong>285 people died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>767 suffered serious injuries</strong>. The names fade, but the numbers do not. Just last week, a woman in Morris Heights was killed by a driver who struck her and fled. Police <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>reported</a> her death. Her family waits for answers. The driver is gone.</p><p>On July 19, a stolen car tore through Chinatown at over 100 miles per hour. It killed Kevin Cruickshank and May Kwok. Kwok was sitting on a bench. Cruickshank was riding his bike. The city’s Department of Transportation promised upgrades, but the dead do not return. NY1 <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>reported</a> that &ldquo;a stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour&mldr;crashed into them.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-blood>Patterns in the Blood</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In three and a half years, cars and SUVs killed <strong>328</strong> and seriously injured <strong>549</strong>. Trucks and buses killed <strong>99</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>11</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The city’s most vulnerable are left to cross streets built for speed, not safety.</p><p>Drivers flee. They run red lights. They turn without looking. The city counts the bodies. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract. It is a mother’s phone that will never ring. It is a bench left empty.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has taken steps. Speed cameras in school zones will stay on through 2030. The Council legalized jaywalking, ending a law that punished the poor and people of color. But the default speed limit is still 25 mph. The city has the power to lower it to 20 mph. It has not used it. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Demand action against repeat speeders. Join the fight with Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The city will not save itself.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.

The crash occurred at 11:35 a.m. The report states the SUV driver was 'distracted' and that 'alcohol was involved.' The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'other actions in roadway,' but the police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The SUV's right front bumper delivered the fatal blow, crushing the man's body. The police narrative describes the victim's death as immediate, with his body 'crumpled beneath the wheels.' No contributing factors are attributed to the pedestrian. The data underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction and impairment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred when the e-bike rider was struck and crushed beneath two southbound vehicles—a 2018 Audi sedan and a 2023 Honda SUV. The report describes the pavement as 'slippery' and the lighting as 'harsh.' The police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, as well as the hazardous road surface. The e-bike was demolished, and the cyclist suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police report notes that all involved vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. No contributing factors are attributed to the victim.

The vehicle's center front end struck a 73-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states she was in the crosswalk and had the light. She suffered fatal head and crush injuries and died at the scene. The SUV sustained no damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the pedestrian, but the narrative confirms the driver turned into the crosswalk while the woman crossed with the light. The driver’s action—making a right turn into a marked crosswalk occupied by a pedestrian—created the lethal impact. The victim’s behavior is noted only to confirm she was crossing with the signal, as reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was found in the roadway with fatal head trauma and crush injuries. The report notes, 'No skid marks. No damage to the truck.' The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Only silence where a life had been.' The vehicle, a 2020 INTL-TRUCK/BUS registered in Indiana, showed no visible damage. The driver was licensed in Pennsylvania. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The police report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing to the crash. The absence of skid marks and damage underscores the brutal efficiency of the impact. The systemic danger remains: a human body, no match for a truck rolling through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The victim died beneath the vehicle’s left front bumper, his head crushed on the pavement. The report notes the absence of a crosswalk at the location. The narrative states, 'No crosswalk. No answers. Just blood on the asphalt and silence in the dark.' The SUV, a 2011 Acura, was traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The victim was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway' at the time of the crash. The report does not cite any specific driver error, but the impact location and fatal outcome underscore the lethal consequences of vehicle-pedestrian collisions on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting the driver’s failure to observe the pedestrian in the crosswalk.

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' in the crosswalk when a Ford SUV, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. She suffered fatal injuries to her lower leg and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention. The system allowed an ordinary turn to become deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
