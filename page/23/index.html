In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

She was crossing with the signal when a southbound dump truck, making a right turn, struck her. The report states the truck showed no damage. The woman died at the scene. The police report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, underscoring the driver's responsibility in the collision. The vehicle involved was a large Ford dump truck, classified as an oversized vehicle, which the report also lists as a contributing factor. The victim's behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's errors. The impact, the loss, and the systemic risk posed by oversized vehicles remain clear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Residents demand NYPD stop blocking sidewalks and bike lanes. No city plan released.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2024, residents and advocates sounded the alarm as NYPD vehicles filled the protected bike lane on Park Row, Manhattan. The event, reported by Streetsblog NYC, followed the removal of metal barricades that had long restricted access. Instead of relief, the community found dozens of police cars and unmarked vehicles parked in the bike lane and on sidewalks. Nick Stabile, co-founder of the Park Row Alliance, said, 'Our residents have difficulty with something as simple as walking down the street and riding their bikes – and it's especially difficult for those in wheelchairs and with strollers.' Lucy West, a local resident, added, 'Park Row is not a parking lot, it's a street.' The city has not announced a plan for the corridor. Local elected officials have called for public input before any changes. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as police continue to block critical space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Laura Shepard, an advocate, calls it 'appalling that the convenience of drivers is prioritized over the lives and limbs of cyclists and pedestrians.'

The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data.

The pilot, part of the 'Charge Safe Ride Safe Action Plan,' opened its first station in Cooper Square. The program, highlighted by Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33), offers 102 charging points for 100 delivery workers, many of them immigrants, at no cost. Three companies—Swobbee, Popwheels, and Swiftmile—operate the FDNY-reviewed stations. The official summary states the pilot 'aims to improve the safety of recharging lithium-ion batteries and counter the demonization of e-bikes.' Mayor Adams said, 'This pilot program ... will give delivery workers the ability to access safe, accessible, outdoor battery-charging that will undoubtedly save lives.' The city faces delays and pushback on e-bike infrastructure, with faster progress for electric cars. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We’re going to be working to address any area where we can make an improvement.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Three companies—Swobbee, Popwheels, and Swiftmile—operate the FDNY-reviewed stations. The pilot brings 102 charging points, slightly more than the city’s first round of electric car chargers. Plans for more locations are in motion, but e-bike infrastructure still trails behind car-focused projects.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
