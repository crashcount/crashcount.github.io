A car slammed into them. Both died. The driver died too. The street was left with bodies and wreckage.

Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>reported, &ldquo;The driver sped off without stopping.

Children, elders, workers—all caught in the path of metal and speed.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed 329 people.</strong> Trucks and buses killed 100. Motorcycles and mopeds, 11. Bikes, 11.

The city can set a 20 mph limit now. But the default is still 25. The city has started to sprinkle 20 mph zones, but not everywhere.</p><p>Speed cameras have been renewed. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the worst drivers rack up tickets and keep driving. One bill—the Stop Super Speeders Act—would force repeat offenders to slow down.

The report states, 'He flew from the bike, landed hard. His skull hit Bronx concrete. Blood on the street. He died there, alone, in the late morning sun.' The police narrative lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but does not cite any driver-specific errors or violations. The cyclist was ejected from his bike and suffered fatal head injuries. The report does not mention helmet use or any other cyclist behavior as a contributing factor. The deadly impact underscores the vulnerability of people on bikes when confronted by heavy vehicles in city traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A 64-year-old man crossed with the light. Steel crushed flesh. The truck stopped. The man lay still. The intersection fell silent, marked by violence and the weight of machinery.</p><p class=mb3>A 64-year-old man was killed when a flatbed truck struck him at the intersection of Bronxwood Avenue and East 229th Street in the Bronx, according to the police report. The crash occurred as the truck was making a left turn. The report states, 'A flatbed truck turned left. A 64-year-old man crossed with the light. The front end struck him. His body crushed beneath steel.' The pedestrian was crossing with the signal at the intersection, as explicitly noted in the police data. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative and vehicle data confirm the truck's left turn and the pedestrian's lawful crossing. The man suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. No driver errors beyond the left turn are specified, but the sequence underscores the lethal risk posed by turning vehicles to people in crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
