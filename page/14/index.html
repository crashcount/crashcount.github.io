A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted corners. Demand action, not words. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is policy.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, now in committee, would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set strict vehicle safety standards that protect pedestrians and cyclists. The measure calls for benchmarks on vehicle height, hood and bumper design, and blind zone size. It also demands that federal consumer safety ratings reflect how dangerous cars are to people outside them. Scanlon said, “Just the raw statistics make a really compelling case about the incredible, exponential rise in pedestrian and bicyclist deaths.” She acknowledged automaker resistance but insisted, “clearly, we need to do something in order to improve safety.” The bill takes aim at the deadly rise of large vehicles and the federal government’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 29-year-old motorcyclist struck its front, was crushed, thrown, and died on the street. His helmet offered no shield against the violence of steel and neglect.</p><p class=mb3>A deadly collision unfolded on Flushing Avenue near Scott Avenue in Brooklyn when a 1987 BMW motorcycle collided with the front quarter of a box truck, according to the police report. The 29-year-old motorcycle rider, who was wearing a helmet, was crushed and partially ejected from his bike. He died at the scene from severe injuries to his entire body. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, drawing attention to the failure of at least one driver to obey traffic signals or signs. Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead at the time of impact. The truck's left front quarter panel was struck, and the motorcycle overturned. The report makes no mention of any victim error or behavior contributing to the crash. The violence of the impact and the disregard for traffic control proved fatal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Blood on the asphalt.</p><p class=mb3>On August 20, 2024, a 16-year-old cyclist, Juraed Umedjon, was killed and two others injured when a truck driver struck them at Ditmas Avenue and Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. The driver was not charged. The intersection sits in a Vision Zero priority zone, yet remains deadly. Transportation Alternatives called the crash 'entirely preventable,' blasting Mayor Adams for slow progress and broken promises. 'If Mayor Adams wants to save lives, he only has to build the streets and intersections that our city needs and our children deserve,' said co-interim director Elizabeth Adams. Despite a 2022 mayoral pledge and DOT promises, no real safety improvements have been made. Activists demand protected bike lanes and street redesign. The toll mounts: twelve children killed in traffic this year, more than almost any year in the last decade.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
