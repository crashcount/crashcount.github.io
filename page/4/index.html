In the last twelve months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on New York’s streets. <strong>707 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—none spared. Just last week, an <strong>8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV</strong> at an intersection in Crown Heights. There was no warning. There was no time. The street was busy, the car was big, and a child did not come home. Streetsblog NYC <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>called it</a> &ldquo;another child sacrificed to the SUV.&rdquo;</p><p>Six more people were struck in the Bronx when a Mustang jumped the curb and plowed into a sidewalk shed. Witnesses heard the screams. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The driver ran. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 300 pedestrians</strong> in the last three years. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 93</strong>. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10</strong>. <strong>Bikes killed 11</strong>. The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. Every crash is a family broken, a street stained.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. The first half of 2025 saw a <strong>32% drop in traffic deaths</strong>. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year because of Vision Zero&rsquo;s focus on safer street designs, expanded public education, and targeted traffic enforcement,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>BKReader</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. Protected bike lanes are being ripped out. The city drags its feet on lowering speed limits. Policies that sound safe sometimes punish the wrong people. A new rule would cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. Michael Replogle, a former DOT official, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it</a> &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save itself.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not remove them. Tell them to stop blaming the people in the crosswalk. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets grow tense. Advocates call it obscene. The crackdown lands hardest on people of color and immigrants. Safety takes a back seat. Punishment rises. Fear spreads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported a major NYPD policy shift. The department now issues criminal court summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders for low-level violations—red lights, stop signs, wrong-way riding. The article, 'NYPD’s Red Light Criminalization Marks ‘Obscene’ Escalation: Advocates,' details the move. Kevin Duggan covered the story. Transportation Alternatives’s Ben Furnas called the change 'an obscene escalation.' Legal experts like Daniel Lambright warned it will amplify racially biased policing, especially against immigrant workers. More than 90% of such summonses in 2024 went to New Yorkers of color. The new policy reverses a decade of decriminalization, exposing thousands to harsh penalties for minor acts. Safety analysts note: 'A quiet change in police practices often signals increased enforcement or surveillance that can disproportionately burden pedestrians and cyclists, potentially discouraging active transportation and undermining safety in numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both drivers remained at the scene. The van driver told the outlet, "I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy." Police have not announced charges. The crash highlights the persistent danger of dooring and the lethal consequences for cyclists when drivers fail to check for oncoming traffic before opening doors.

Activists like Corey Hannigan and Sara Lind criticize the NYPD for targeting cyclists instead of drivers, who cause most crashes and deaths. Cyclist Lee calls the practice 'unjust.' Kate Brockwehl, injured by a car, says the policy shows 'windshield bias.' The Department of Transportation has proposed legalizing the 'Idaho Stop' for cyclists, but City Hall has blocked it.

He has fought these battles before.</p><p class=mb3>On April 17, 2025, Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander joined a Streetsblog reporter for a bike ride, laying out his transportation vision. Lander stressed his record: 'By the time I'm done, you're going to have a lot more bus and bike infrastructure, more of the neighborhood loading zones that use the curb, more of those shared containers, especially in denser areas.' He contrasted his approach with the Adams administration, calling out backroom deals and broken promises. Lander cited his support for protected bike lanes, even when facing opposition. He pledged to make it easier for families to use e-cargo bikes by building safer routes. Lander committed to expanding the Fourth Avenue bike lane to Bay Ridge and reducing car space citywide. He promised 'world-class DOT and transportation leadership.' No formal safety analysis was provided, but Lander’s stance centers vulnerable road users and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger stays on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On April 16, 2025, Mayor Adams’s administration postponed the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Third Avenue safety redesign in Brooklyn. The plan, not yet assigned a council bill number, aimed to cut car lanes, add a protected bike lane, and install pedestrian islands. The DOT cited the need for more public input after business leaders, led by the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, protested. The matter summary reads: 'The Department of Transportation (DOT) planned to reduce car lanes and add a protected bike lane and pedestrian islands, but business leaders...protested.' Community board support was strong. Streetsblog NYC reported that 68 percent of locals backed the changes. Council members were not named, but business owners and advocates like Jon Orcutt and Jim of Bagels By the Park spoke out. The administration’s delay leaves proven safety measures on hold, exposing vulnerable road users to continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ten repeat offenders rack up hundreds of speed-camera tickets. Fines do nothing. Advocates demand action. The Stop Super Speeders Bill would force speed limiters on these drivers. Lawmakers stall. Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>The Stop Super Speeders Bill (S7621) is under debate. It would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year. The bill is supported by Amber Adler of Families for Safe Streets and Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, who call out the deadly pattern of repeat offenders. Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive. The NYPD withholds license plate data, blocking public scrutiny. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has expired, leaving no replacement. Advocates say the bill is urgent to stop the next tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
