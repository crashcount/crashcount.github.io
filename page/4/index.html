The article, titled 'Exclusive: Cops Writing 15% of Their Red Light Tix to Cyclists, Who are Just 2% of Road Users,' highlights a stark enforcement imbalance. Activists like Corey Hannigan and Sara Lind criticize the NYPD for targeting cyclists instead of drivers, who cause most crashes and deaths. Cyclist Lee calls the practice 'unjust.' Kate Brockwehl, injured by a car, says the policy shows 'windshield bias.' The Department of Transportation has proposed legalizing the 'Idaho Stop' for cyclists, but City Hall has blocked it. Cyclists like John Surico and George Calderaro say most tickets come from coordinated police actions, not real safety concerns. The data shows enforcement priorities ignore who poses real danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He contrasted his approach with the Adams administration, calling out backroom deals and broken promises. Lander cited his support for protected bike lanes, even when facing opposition. He pledged to make it easier for families to use e-cargo bikes by building safer routes. Lander committed to expanding the Fourth Avenue bike lane to Bay Ridge and reducing car space citywide.

Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive.

The incident occurred in the pre-dawn hours, with the report stating, 'A man stood in the street. A box truck came, head-on. His skull broke under steel. He died there, alone in the dark. The truck rolled on, untouched.' The pedestrian suffered fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian, offering no further details on the cause. The truck sustained no damage, and the driver continued on without stopping. The report notes the pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal impact and the unanswered questions surrounding the driver's actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Tragedy Underscores Shortcomings of Vision Zero Era State Ocean Parkway Fixes,' highlights the failure of current efforts. Despite millions spent on speed cameras and signals, the six-lane highway remains deadly. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov called for higher speed limits. State Senator Simcha Felder pushed for a 30 mph limit, above the citywide standard. Advocates like Jon Orcutt demand deeper redesigns—lane reductions, pedestrian islands. Residents and experts say enforcement alone cannot save lives. Local opposition and political power block bold changes. The city DOT promises more work, but the danger persists. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
