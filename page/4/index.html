The city’s streets are a slow-moving disaster. Every week brings new names. A 21-year-old woman, Madison Ruiz, killed as her boyfriend spun donuts in a Brooklyn parking lot. Her nephews, ages 12 and 17, left bleeding by the curb. Days later, the tire marks still scarred the pavement. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom.

The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. The city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the price.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p>City Hall claims progress. Speed cameras renewed. New 20 mph zones near schools. But the citywide speed limit remains 25 mph. The law lets leaders drop it to 20 mph now. They have not. Each day of delay risks another life. The city touts record bike lanes and intersection daylighting. But the crackdowns fall hardest on cyclists and e-bike delivery workers, not the drivers who do the most harm. Community boards <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/cart-before-horse-upper-west-siders-demand-nypd-halt-bike-crackdown>call it out</a>: &ldquo;It sends the wrong message about the actual danger on our streets.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide limit. Demand real action against repeat speeders. Join the fight.

The fuselage, rotor, and tail tore loose. Loud bangs echoed. The craft plunged. No black box. No warning. Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
