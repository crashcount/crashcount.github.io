In the last twelve months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on New York’s streets. <strong>707 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—none spared. Just last week, an <strong>8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV</strong> at an intersection in Crown Heights. There was no warning. There was no time. The street was busy, the car was big, and a child did not come home. Streetsblog NYC <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>called it</a> &ldquo;another child sacrificed to the SUV.&rdquo;</p><p>Six more people were struck in the Bronx when a Mustang jumped the curb and plowed into a sidewalk shed. Witnesses heard the screams. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The driver ran. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 300 pedestrians</strong> in the last three years. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 93</strong>. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10</strong>. <strong>Bikes killed 11</strong>. The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. Every crash is a family broken, a street stained.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. The first half of 2025 saw a <strong>32% drop in traffic deaths</strong>. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year because of Vision Zero&rsquo;s focus on safer street designs, expanded public education, and targeted traffic enforcement,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>BKReader</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. Protected bike lanes are being ripped out. The city drags its feet on lowering speed limits. Policies that sound safe sometimes punish the wrong people. A new rule would cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. Michael Replogle, a former DOT official, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it</a> &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save itself.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not remove them. Tell them to stop blaming the people in the crosswalk. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, detailed by City Hall's Office of Management and Budget, aims to install granite blocks, bike racks, and other barriers at hundreds of corners. Adams said, 'We are ... keeping New Yorkers safe on our streets ... by improving road safety at hundreds of targeted traffic intersections.' State law bans parking within 20 feet of intersections, but New York City exempts itself, fueling deadly crashes—55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries happen at intersections. Council members and grassroots activists are pushing to end the city's carveout and require the Department of Transportation to add barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'Hardening is what makes daylighting actually work, so the budget item is really crucial to expanding it across the city.' The push follows the 2023 death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a poorly designed corner.

The new rules, set to enter the NYPD patrol guide on February 1, 2025, allow chases only for serious violent crimes. Tisch stated, 'The NYPD’s enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk, and pursuits for violations and low-level crimes can be both potentially dangerous and unnecessary.' The policy comes after a spike in chases—up 1,413 percent since 2022—and several fatal crashes, including the death of cyclist Amanda Servedio. Tisch’s directive, supported by Chief of Department John Chell, gives officers clear, unambiguous parameters and shields them from discipline for terminating unsafe pursuits. The department will review chases monthly to ensure compliance. The reform aims to end reckless chases for minor offenses, reducing harm to pedestrians, cyclists, and bystanders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as aiming to 'better organize the park's roads for cyclists, pedestrians, and e-bike users,' includes a protected bike lane on the 86th Street transverse and separate lanes for different users. Board member Sebastian Hallum Clarke introduced the substitute resolution backing the plan. David Saltonstall of the Conservancy stressed the need for separation, referencing Olmsted’s original design. The board rejected a proposed e-bike ban, instead supporting safer, separated space for all. The vote followed heated opposition from anti-cycling activists, but the board chose safety and organization over fear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2025, the chairs of Community Boards 4, 5, and 6 called on Mayor Adams to build a busway and widen sidewalks on 42nd Street. The matter, titled 'Midtown to Adams: It’s Time For A 42nd Street Busway!', highlights the need to 'significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 42nd Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' Christine Berthet, co-chair of CB 4 Transportation Committee, stressed that busways make intersections safer for pedestrians. The Department of Transportation, represented by spokesperson Mona Bruno, stated its commitment to safer streets for pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders. The proposal follows the proven gains of the 14th Street busway and comes as congestion pricing looms. DOT has lagged on protected bus lanes, and Adams faces mounting pressure to prioritize vulnerable road users over private vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable users wait. Progress is slow. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On January 7, 2025, the city launched congestion pricing. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has not delivered key improvements, like a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway. The matter, described as 'Advocacy and Policy Critique on NYC Street Design and Transportation Improvements Post-Congestion Pricing,' highlights the city’s failure to act. Advocates Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) and Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) urge the city to reclaim space for people, not cars. Sara Lind calls for bold changes, saying, 'This is a dream scenario, to be gifted more space in New York City.' DOT has added a bike lane to the Brooklyn Bridge and bus lanes on the Washington Bridge, but most projects lag. The Adams administration faces criticism for its lack of urgency. With car traffic down, advocates demand immediate action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
