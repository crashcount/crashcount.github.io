Police said, <strong>“The driver sped off without stopping.

The city data logs it at South Conduit Ave and 155th St. A man walking. A car’s front end. One life gone.</p><p>The next morning in Astoria, an 84‑year‑old in a Toyota jumped the curb and crushed two men ordering food. A witness said, <strong>“I have never seen anything like this.”</strong> <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY</a>. <strong>Two pedestrians died.</strong> The driver died too. The block filled with wreckage and sirens. Another family waited at a hospital that could not help.</p><p>Days earlier in the Bronx, a 44‑year‑old woman was struck on Macombs Rd at W 174 St. City records list <strong>driver distraction</strong> and <strong>“crush injuries.”</strong> She died there. A sidewalk. A body bag. Quiet after the tape comes down.</p><h3 id=the-system-talks-streets-dont-wait>The System Talks. Streets Don’t Wait.</h3><p>At City Hall, plans move at a designer’s pace.

Good, but the funerals are now. On the highways, the courts speak after the blood dries. After a 2023 wrong‑way rampage, the Queens DA said, <strong>“[He] terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way… and crashed into multiple cars.”</strong> <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. <strong>Two motorists were badly hurt</strong> and, she added, <strong>“still have not fully recovered.”</strong> <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=the-count-that-wont-stop>The Count That Won’t Stop</h3><p>Since 2022, NYC has logged <strong>1,105 deaths</strong> and <strong>194,320 injuries</strong> in crashes [city data].

The BMW then careened into parked vehicles, fatally striking Dwight Downer, a retired correction officer and high school football coach. Police say Berry fled the scene and was later charged with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.

A man in his 20s, crouched in the street to pick up food, was struck and killed by a turning dump truck just before 4 a.m. at Withers Street and Woodpoint Road. The NYPD stated, “The driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene.” No arrests have been made. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. The article notes this was one of several deadly crashes in Brooklyn that week, highlighting ongoing risks for pedestrians and the persistent issue of hit-and-runs. At least 10 people have died in Brooklyn traffic crashes so far this year, matching last year’s pace.
