In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

According to the police report, the crash occurred just after midnight, and the street was dark. The report states the driver was inattentive or distracted at the time of the collision. The impact was so forceful that parked cars were damaged. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk when struck, but the police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The driver’s permit status is noted in the narrative, underscoring a lack of full licensure. The report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing factors. The focus remains on the driver’s distraction and permit status, which led to fatal consequences for the man in the roadway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, "A van veered, struck a station wagon. The SUV’s driver, 54, died belted in place. The airbag burst. His body broke inside." The driver of the SUV was killed, suffering injuries to his entire body despite the deployment of the airbag and use of a lap belt. Two others were in the van. The police report explicitly cites "Unsafe Lane Changing" as the contributing factor. The van’s pre-crash action is listed as "Changing Lanes," and the point of impact was the center front end. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the van driver’s unsafe maneuver, which led directly to the fatal outcome.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

It also introduces a crashworthiness program to measure injury risk to people struck by a vehicle’s front end.

The victim died beneath the vehicle’s left front bumper, his head crushed on the pavement. The report notes the absence of a crosswalk at the location. The narrative states, 'No crosswalk. No answers. Just blood on the asphalt and silence in the dark.' The SUV, a 2011 Acura, was traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The victim was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway' at the time of the crash. The report does not cite any specific driver error, but the impact location and fatal outcome underscore the lethal consequences of vehicle-pedestrian collisions on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the truck’s left front bumper hit her head, rendering her unconscious. She suffered internal injuries and died at the scene. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting the driver’s failure to observe the pedestrian in the crosswalk. The woman was crossing with no signal present, as noted in the report, but the primary fault cited is driver inattention. The collision occurred in broad daylight, and the pickup showed no damage. The deadly impact underscores the ongoing danger faced by pedestrians on Staten Island streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Pedestrian injuries dropped 35 percent. Traffic deaths fell 68 percent. Cyclists fill the lanes. Concrete upgrades loom, but mountable curbs may let cars intrude.</p><p class=mb3>On November 13, 2024, the Department of Transportation celebrated a decade of safety improvements on Queens Boulevard. The event marked the completion of protected bike lanes along nearly the entire corridor, except for one block. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Several elements of this redesign aim at enhancing safety for all road users: Curbside bike lanes to enhance cyclist safety, pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances while encouraging slower, safe turns, and additional adjustments to traffic signal timing to allow more time for pedestrians to cross before the lights turn green." The project, begun in 2015 under Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced local opposition and political delays but persisted. The city reports a 68 percent drop in traffic fatalities and a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian injuries since the redesign began. Cyclist numbers surged by 450 percent. DOT plans to upgrade bike lanes with concrete, but mountable curbs could leave lanes exposed to cars. Families for Safe Streets activist Lizi Rahman called the redesign a model for dangerous roads everywhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' in the crosswalk when a Ford SUV, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. She suffered fatal injuries to her lower leg and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention. The system allowed an ordinary turn to become deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
