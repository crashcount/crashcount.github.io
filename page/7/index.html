He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city recorded <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>281 deaths and 766 serious injuries in the last 12 months</a>.

They do not give second chances.</p><p>The killers are familiar: <strong>cars, SUVs, trucks, buses</strong>. Sedans alone took 93 pedestrian lives. SUVs killed 200 more.

Every day of delay is another risk, another name on the list.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The article reports, "Yarimi, 35, was driving nearly double the speed limit when her Audi allegedly struck an Uber, flipped and mowed down the family." Police say Miriam Yarimi drove with a suspended license, no insurance, and expired registration, and ran a red light. She faces multiple charges, including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The crash also injured an Uber driver and passengers. The case highlights the lethal consequences of unchecked speeding and gaps in enforcement against unlicensed, uninsured drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states that a mother and her three children were crossing in the crosswalk with the pedestrian signal when the vehicle struck them. The impact killed the 34-year-old woman and two of her children, ages five and eight. A four-year-old boy was left unconscious and severely injured. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the driver. The pedestrians were crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The sedan's center front end struck the victims, underscoring the lethal consequences of ignoring traffic controls. The driver’s unlicensed status and disregard for the signal are central to this tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The van's right front bumper struck a 65-year-old man who was crossing the intersection with the pedestrian signal. The report states the man suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The van sustained no damage. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor. The victim's action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's failure to yield. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers fail to respect pedestrian priority at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A driver with a suspended license crashed, then hit the family in a crosswalk. The youngest son survived after surgery. Nine others were hurt. The street ran red with grief.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (March 29, 2025), a suspended driver with a record of '15 school zone speeding and red-light tickets in the last 12 months' collided with an Uber and struck a family crossing Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called it 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn’t have been on the road.' The crash killed Natasha Saada, 35, and her daughters, Diana, 7, and Debra, 5. A four-year-old son was critically injured but survived surgery. The Audi driver, Miriam Yarimi, was arrested at the scene. Policy gaps loom: Yarimi’s history of fines and violations did not keep her off the road. Both drivers were to be tested for impairment. The incident highlights systemic failures in keeping dangerous drivers away from city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
