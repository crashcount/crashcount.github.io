According to the police report, a 2012 Acura sedan experienced 'Tire Failure/Inadequate,' causing the vehicle to veer off course and strike a parked Hyundai sedan. The report states, 'A tire gave out. A 2012 Acura veered into a parked Hyundai.' The sole occupant, a 29-year-old woman in the driver's seat, was killed in the collision. No contributing factors are listed for the victim beyond the tire failure. The parked Hyundai was unoccupied. The police report makes clear that the crash was set in motion by the mechanical failure, with the Acura's driver losing control and the vehicle striking a stationary car. The scene remained still, marked by the loss and the silence that followed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic control was ignored,' identifying 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead when they collided. The police narrative makes clear that the drivers' failure to obey traffic controls directly led to the deadly collision.

The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.'

The plan cuts car lanes, adds parking-protected bike lanes, and shortens crossings. Advocates and locals back the move. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger here. The city finally acts.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2024, the Department of Transportation proposed protected bike lanes for the westernmost mile of Queens Boulevard, between Skillman Avenue and Roosevelt Avenue. The plan, covered by Streetsblog NYC, would reduce car lanes from five to three in each direction, making room for eight-foot parking-protected bike lanes. Painted islands would shield cyclists at intersections and shorten pedestrian crossings. The proposal responds to years of crashes and injuries in a high-traffic area. Community advocates, including Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives and Joby Jacob of LaGuardia Community College, voiced strong support. Jacob called it 'absolutely necessary,' while Shepard said, 'This has been a missing link for a really long time.' The Thomson Avenue extension remains in early planning, with ongoing advocacy for more sidewalk space and safer access. Vision Zero funds are allocated, but advocates push for more. The city’s move follows years of criticism over insufficient safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets grew quiet. Bike lanes widened. Pedestrians took space. Crashes fell. Air cleared. Shops thrived. Stockholm’s crash rate is a third of New York’s. The lesson is blunt: fewer cars, safer streets, more life.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published May 13, 2024, in Streetsblog NYC, draws on Sweden’s decade of congestion pricing. The article, titled 'Congestion Pricing Will Make New York a World-Class City,' details how Gothenburg and Stockholm used tolls to reduce car traffic, fund transit, and reclaim streets for people. Per Bergström-Jonsson, a Swedish official, says, 'Congestion pricing improved travel times far more than all other road investments.' Stockholm’s crash deaths are a third of New York’s. Council members are not directly named, as this is an advocacy article, but the stance is clear: support for congestion pricing, bike infrastructure, transit, and pedestrianization. The Swedish experience shows that fewer cars mean safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
