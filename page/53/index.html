In the last twelve months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on New York’s streets. <strong>707 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—none spared. Just last week, an <strong>8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV</strong> at an intersection in Crown Heights. There was no warning. There was no time. The street was busy, the car was big, and a child did not come home. Streetsblog NYC <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>called it</a> &ldquo;another child sacrificed to the SUV.&rdquo;</p><p>Six more people were struck in the Bronx when a Mustang jumped the curb and plowed into a sidewalk shed. Witnesses heard the screams. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The driver ran. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 300 pedestrians</strong> in the last three years. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 93</strong>. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10</strong>. <strong>Bikes killed 11</strong>. The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. Every crash is a family broken, a street stained.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. The first half of 2025 saw a <strong>32% drop in traffic deaths</strong>. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year because of Vision Zero&rsquo;s focus on safer street designs, expanded public education, and targeted traffic enforcement,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>BKReader</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. Protected bike lanes are being ripped out. The city drags its feet on lowering speed limits. Policies that sound safe sometimes punish the wrong people. A new rule would cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. Michael Replogle, a former DOT official, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it</a> &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save itself.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not remove them. Tell them to stop blaming the people in the crosswalk. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 60-year-old male driver was trapped and incoherent, suffering crush injuries. In the right rear seat, a 76-year-old woman was also trapped and killed, her body crushed. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' as contributing factors. Neither occupant wore safety equipment, as noted after the driver errors.

It demands speed governors in new cars and direct visibility for heavy SUVs. The measure aims to cut traffic deaths and force safer vehicles onto New York streets. Oversized cars face new scrutiny.</p><p class=mb3>On August 12, 2022, Manhattan State Senator Brad Hoylman introduced a bill in the New York State Senate. The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report surveyed 727 placard-bearing cars, finding widespread illegal parking in crosswalks, bus stops, and truck zones. The article states: 'Lower Manhattan is overwhelmed by cars with city, state, and federal placards—many of them fake or misused—allowing public employees to park for free or illegally.' Advocacy leader Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives called for ending placard abuse and repurposing parking for people, not cars. The NYPD rarely enforces the law, despite mounting crashes and blocked streets. The report urges strict enforcement and reclaiming space for vulnerable road users. The danger grows as city leaders fail to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Janice Mott called this excuse 'ridiculous,' insisting, 'That street should be closed during school hours, or at least when kids are coming to school or leaving.' Janice and James Mott, a traffic engineer, both said a dedicated bike lane would have saved Carling’s life. Suraj Patel, running in the 12th Congressional District, criticized Maloney’s actions as 'an abuse of power.'

She called for crosstown bike lanes and truck barriers. She named the danger: wide trucks, narrow streets, no safe passage. Her voice cut through the noise. She demanded action. Streets must change.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2022, Janice Mott, mother of Carling Mott—a cyclist killed by a tractor trailer on the Upper East Side—delivered a public plea for safer streets. In her statement, she urged the City Council and Department of Transportation to install dedicated crosstown bike lanes, especially on East 85th Street, and to add truck stanchions to block oversized vehicles from restricted roads. Mott highlighted the lack of east-west bike paths in Yorkville and the ongoing threat posed by illegal truck traffic. She said, 'Immediately add safe corridors east/west so that we can prevent another tragedy from happening now in the Upper East Side.' Mott reached out to local council members and Suraj Patel, supporting his safe corridor policies. Her call is clear: build safe, accessible crosstown routes to protect cyclists and all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
