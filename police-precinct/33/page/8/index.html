They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood pools most often. They can act, or they can wait for the next siren. In the last year, <strong>crashes dropped 10%</strong>. Injuries fell, but serious injuries doubled.

Every day of waiting is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.
