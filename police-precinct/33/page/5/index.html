The rear motorcycle, operated by a 33-year-old man, was 'following too closely' and struck the motorcycle ahead. The report states the rear rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet. The collision left him with severe lacerations to his lower leg, described as his leg 'split open' and blood pooling at the scene. Both motorcycles were damaged at the center front and back ends, consistent with a rear-end impact. The police report explicitly lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the rear rider. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers fail to maintain safe distance and speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
