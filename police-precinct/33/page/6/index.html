A 73-year-old cyclist, lifeless on Saint Nicholas Avenue. A child, age 9, left bleeding on W 165th, head split open by a moped. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 killed, 3 seriously injured</strong>. <strong>254 hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch.

Trucks and taxis, too, left their mark. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is heavier, faster, harder.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-33>The Role of Precinct 33</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood pools most often. They can act, or they can wait for the next siren. In the last year, <strong>crashes dropped 10%</strong>. Injuries fell, but serious injuries doubled. Two more families mourn. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>The city has new powers. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets leaders set safer speed limits. The law sits, waiting for action. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Local leaders can push for lower speeds, more cameras, safer crossings. Or they can wait. Every day of waiting is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Do not wait for another body in the street. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
