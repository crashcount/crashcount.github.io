Sixteen more have been left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly a thousand have been hurt since 2022. Each number is a wound that does not heal. A nine-year-old boy, struck in the head by a moped on Edgecombe Avenue this spring, left bleeding in the street. A 73-year-old man, killed on his bike at Saint Nicholas and 165th. A 76-year-old man, dead at the intersection of Broadway and 161st, his life ended by a sedan moving too fast for the light to matter. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> They caused the most deaths and injuries to pedestrians here—one dead, six seriously hurt, over 150 injured. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but the scale is different. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable always lose.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>The police in Precinct 33 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the work is not done. In the last year, injuries rose by 8%. Serious injuries tripled—from 1 to 3. The disaster is not slowing down.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to act. They can push for lower speed limits, more daylighted corners, and protected crossings. They can demand the precinct crack down on reckless driving. But too often, the silence is louder than the sirens. &ldquo;We need to do something to make sure bicyclists feel safer,&rdquo; said a community board leader, but the city keeps cutting bike lanes and delaying real change <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.
