Pedestrians suffered 181 strikes by sedans and SUVs alone. These figures come straight from the city’s dataset and rollup for this precinct.</li><li>Two deaths sit on the <a href=#>Henry Hudson Parkway</a> in this period. In one crash, an SUV, two sedans, and a pickup collided; two occupants died. The city’s record lists improper lane use for one driver and notes a demolished pickup in the pileup <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4750210</a>.</li><li>A 76‑year‑old man was killed at Broadway and West 161st. The file marks “Tinted Windows” and “Unsafe Speed” for the driver; the pedestrian was at the intersection. He died there <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4672150</a>.</li></ul><p>Where people get hit</p><ul><li>DOT’s map of harm here is not a secret. <strong>Broadway</strong> shows a death and 92 injuries. <strong>Amsterdam Avenue</strong> shows 50 injuries and three serious injuries. <strong>West 178th Street</strong> shows 36 injuries and three serious injuries. These are the top hotspots named in the precinct rollup.</li><li>The hours run long. Injuries spike late at night and into the small hours. At 2 a.m., two people died across the period, with 28 injured. From midnight to 3 a.m., the sheets stack up: 81, 26, 28, 41 injuries by the hour. By evening rush, harm rises again at 6 p.m. with a death and four serious injuries, and at 7 p.m. with 86 injuries.</li><li>On July 24, a 47‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal at Fort Washington Ave and West 179th was struck by a left‑turning SUV. The record lists “Driver Inexperience” and “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” She survived with severe injuries <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4831046</a>.</li></ul><p>Who bears the force</p><ul><li>Pedestrians: 208 injured, 9 seriously, and 1 killed. Cyclists: 145 injured and 1 killed. Occupants: 693 injured, 6 seriously, and 2 killed. That’s the split the city gives for this command.</li><li>The city’s normalized rollup shows sedans and SUVs as the main striking force for pedestrians here: 77 pedestrian casualties from sedans, 68 from SUVs. Trucks and buses account for fewer, but each strike is heavy.</li><li>Causes the city tags most often in serious outcomes include “failure to yield,” “disregarded traffic control,” “unsafe speed,” and “inattention.” One more line item—“other”—anchors the largest share of death and injury in the rollup, an indictment by absence.</li></ul><p>What officials say when people die</p><ul><li>After two bystanders were killed in a 109‑mph crash off the Manhattan Bridge, the city promised fixes on Canal Street. The transportation chief said, “we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long‑term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>. NY1 wrote that “the redesign aims to improve the pedestrian experience” on 14th Street next year, with city and BID money behind it <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>NY1</a>.</li><li>The pattern is citywide: big promises after blood on the street, and corridor plans that leave the most dangerous blocks waiting. “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” said Ben Furnas. “The vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>.</li></ul><p>What would stop the turning cars</p><ul><li>On these corners—Broadway at West 161st; Fort Washington at West 179th; Amsterdam and the cross streets—the fixes are not exotic. Daylight the corners so drivers can see. Harden lefts to slow turns. Give walkers a head start at the signal. These are standard tools. They fit the causes listed: failure to yield, inattention, unsafe speed.</li><li>Target the repeat hotspots. DOT knows them: <strong>Amsterdam Avenue</strong>, <strong>West 178th Street</strong>, <strong>Broadway</strong>. Return until the injury lines fall. Night hours show pain; align enforcement and signal timing when the bodies hit the asphalt.</li></ul><p>Citywide levers that matter here</p><ul><li>The Council and DOT can take one clean step: <strong>lower the default speed limit</strong>. The case is made in the city’s own numbers and in the record of speed control. Then back it with tech for the worst actors.</li><li>One bill on deck in Albany would force the most reckless to install intelligent speed‑assistance after racking up repeat violations. Advocates call it the Stop Super Speeders Act. The point is simple: stop repeat speeders before they stop someone’s heart.</li></ul><p>Do something now</p><ul><li>These corners will not fix themselves. Ask your leaders to use the tools they already have. One call matters. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</li></ul></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
