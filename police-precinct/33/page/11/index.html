Sixteen more have been left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly a thousand have been hurt since 2022. Each number is a wound that does not heal. A nine-year-old boy, struck in the head by a moped on Edgecombe Avenue this spring, left bleeding in the street. A 73-year-old man, killed on his bike at Saint Nicholas and 165th. A 76-year-old man, dead at the intersection of Broadway and 161st, his life ended by a sedan moving too fast for the light to matter. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> They caused the most deaths and injuries to pedestrians here—one dead, six seriously hurt, over 150 injured. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but the scale is different. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable always lose.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>The police in Precinct 33 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the work is not done. In the last year, injuries rose by 8%. Serious injuries tripled—from 1 to 3. The disaster is not slowing down.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to act. They can push for lower speed limits, more daylighted corners, and protected crossings. They can demand the precinct crack down on reckless driving. But too often, the silence is louder than the sirens. &ldquo;We need to do something to make sure bicyclists feel safer,&rdquo; said a community board leader, but the city keeps cutting bike lanes and delaying real change <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the city waits, another family risks losing someone. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to join the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
