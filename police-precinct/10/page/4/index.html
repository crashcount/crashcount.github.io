Four were seriously injured. <strong>No deaths this year—yet.</strong> But the numbers do not tell the whole story. They do not show the blood on the asphalt, the broken bikes, the lives bent out of shape.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled. He later told police he ran because he had no license. The cyclist was left with a shattered skull. He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license, as <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>reported by West Side Spirit</a>.</p><p>On July 31, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. No word on charges. No word on why. &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>said ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> In three years, 656 people have been injured here. Four have died. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross the street. SUVs and cars did most of the harm—119 crashes with injuries or worse. Trucks and buses struck 32. Bikes were involved in 24. Motorcycles and mopeds in 6. The pattern is clear. The largest vehicles do the most damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. But too often, the response is slow or silent. After the e-bike crash, police said the investigation was ongoing. The driver turned himself in. The cyclist lay in the hospital.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for slower speeds, safer crossings, and real accountability. But change comes slow. The blood dries before the next meeting.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at the worst intersections. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Metal struck flesh. Samuel Williams, riding his dirt bike, was thrown and killed. Body cam footage shows the officer’s move. Another NYPD car tried the same. The city sent Williams’ family a bill.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2024-12-23) reports that NYPD body camera footage shows an officer veering into the path of Samuel Williams, a 36-year-old dirt bike rider, during a pursuit on the University Heights Bridge. Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
