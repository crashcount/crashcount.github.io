Four were seriously injured. <strong>No deaths this year—yet.</strong> But the numbers do not tell the whole story. They do not show the blood on the asphalt, the broken bikes, the lives bent out of shape.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled. He later told police he ran because he had no license. The cyclist was left with a shattered skull. He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license, as <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>reported by West Side Spirit</a>.</p><p>On July 31, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. No word on charges. No word on why. &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>said ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> In three years, 656 people have been injured here. Four have died. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to cross the street. SUVs and cars did most of the harm—119 crashes with injuries or worse. Trucks and buses struck 32. Bikes were involved in 24. Motorcycles and mopeds in 6. The pattern is clear. The largest vehicles do the most damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. But too often, the response is slow or silent. After the e-bike crash, police said the investigation was ongoing. The driver turned himself in. The cyclist lay in the hospital.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for slower speeds, safer crossings, and real accountability. But change comes slow. The blood dries before the next meeting.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at the worst intersections. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The NYPD Collision Investigation Squad is reviewing the incident; no arrests have been made.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.'

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

Federal threats landed flat. Letters flew. Deadlines passed. The fight over Manhattan’s tolls moved to courtrooms. Officials called the process a sham. Transit funding hung in the balance. Streets stayed dangerous. Cars kept coming.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published May 22, 2025), the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) refused to halt Manhattan’s congestion pricing despite a fourth federal deadline. The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.' The federal government’s push to end the tolls, and the MTA’s resistance, highlight a clash over control of city streets and transit funding. No mention of driver actions, but the policy fight leaves vulnerable road users exposed as the legal battle drags on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan widens sidewalks by 46% and cuts traffic lanes from five to three, aiming to boost pedestrian access. However, the redesign omits dedicated bus and bike lanes. Advocates criticized the move: 'Two mayors have now disregarded city workers' plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques,' said Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance. Transportation Alternatives called the plan a failure, noting Fifth Avenue's slow bus speeds and lack of cycling infrastructure.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
