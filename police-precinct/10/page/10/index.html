Ten left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, there have been <strong>593 injuries</strong> from crashes—each one a life changed, a family shaken. No one under 18 has died, but nine children have been hurt in the last year alone. The old are not spared. An 86-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at 8th Avenue and West 25th, struck by an SUV. Her body was broken by a driver who failed to yield, who was distracted, who did not stop in time, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Cyclists are not safe here. In 2022, a 66-year-old man was killed on his bike at 11th Avenue and West 37th. In 2023, a 39-year-old cyclist was left bloodied by a taxi on West 36th. In November 2024, a 16-year-old was seriously injured by a taxi’s left turn at 10th Avenue and West 33rd. The street does not forgive mistakes, and it does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-the-police>The Role of the Police</h3><p><strong>Precinct 10 has the power to act.</strong> The police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood pools most often. They can make it clear that reckless driving is not just a risk, but a crime. But action is not always taken. The silence after each crash is as loud as the sirens that follow.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. They talk about speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But in Precinct 10, the danger remains. <strong>No new laws or redesigns will matter if they are not enforced.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. The police, the city, and the state have the tools. They need to use them. Residents must demand action. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand change. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
