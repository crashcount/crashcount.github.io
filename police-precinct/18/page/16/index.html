Thirty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,300 hurt since 2022. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just this year, the carnage continues. <strong>Six killed and 235 injured since January.</strong> Among them, the old and the young. Three people over 65 lost their lives. Two more over 75. A cyclist, age 67, died on Fifth Avenue. An 83-year-old woman was struck crossing with the signal at 58th and Sixth. A 39-year-old man was killed by a bus on East 51st. These are not numbers. These are lives ended in the street.</p><h2 id=the-crashes-no-one-stops>The Crashes No One Stops</h2><p>The pattern is clear. <strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> They caused three deaths and nearly 300 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed one and hurt dozens more. Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill. The street does not care who you are. It only matters who is behind the wheel.</p><p>The news does not stop. On July 2, two buses collided at Port Authority, injuring fourteen. <strong>&ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo;</strong> said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon. <strong>&ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>reported ABC7</a>. The tunnel filled with sirens. The ramp was blocked. The city kept moving, but the wounded did not.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h2><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. New laws. But the work is not done. The police in Precinct 18 can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target the corners where people keep dying. They can make it stop. They just need to act.</p><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The dead cannot call for change. The living must do it for them.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them the deaths must end. Tell them to enforce the law, slow the cars, and protect the people who walk and bike these streets. Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
