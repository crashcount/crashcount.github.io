The crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours, shattering the quiet with metal and glass. All four occupants of the SUV—aged 23 to 36—suffered serious injuries, including head trauma and crush injuries, and were left in shock. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the SUV occupants, with the driver specifically cited for failing to yield. The tractor-trailer was parked and unoccupied at the time of impact. The narrative describes the violence of the crash: 'The front folded. Metal screamed. Four inside: arms broken, heads bloodied, bodies crushed.' The data points to driver error and systemic danger as the root causes of this early-morning disaster.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
