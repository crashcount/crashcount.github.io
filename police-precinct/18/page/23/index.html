Thirty-five left with wounds so deep they will never be the same. These are not numbers. They are lives cut short, bodies broken, families left waiting for a voice at the end of the day that will never come.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist was struck in Washington Heights. The driver fled. The intersection, locals say, has been a problem for years. <em>“No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,”</em> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a resident</a>. The cyclist survived. Next time, someone will not.</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> They are the heavy hands in this story. Since 2022, cars and SUVs have caused 3 deaths and 310 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists here. Trucks and buses have killed once, injured 39. Motorcycles and mopeds, 25 injuries. Bikes, 57 injuries. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is bigger, who is faster, who is left standing.</p><p>The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, five people over 65 died. Children have been hurt. The city’s promises ring hollow when the sirens fade and the blood dries on the crosswalk.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h2><p>The police in Precinct 18 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at the corners where people die and say, Not here, not today. But too often, the work is left undone. After the latest hit-and-run, officers checked the victim and left. The driver vanished. <em>“That almost looks like he was doing it on purpose,”</em> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a witness</a>.</p><p>Local leaders have passed laws. They have spoken of Vision Zero and safer streets. But the bodies keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits, to redesign streets, to end the carnage. They have not used it. Not yet.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Stand where the blood has dried and say, Enough. If you do not act, nothing will change.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
