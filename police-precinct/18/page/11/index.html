Since 2022, <strong>12 people are dead</strong> and <strong>1,484 are hurt</strong> on streets patrolled by Precinct 18. Pedestrians and cyclists take the hardest blows. The tally runs without pause. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data says so</a>.</p><h3 id=w-51st-w-47th-w-58th-names-on-the-map-lives-in-the-balance>W 51st, W 47th, W 58th: names on the map, lives in the balance</h3><p>Three cyclists died here. Five pedestrians died. The bodies and broken bones pile up at corners we all know: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 51 St</a> (three dead), <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 47 St</a> (two dead), and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 58 St</a> (one dead). On April 22, 2024, a taxi driver killed himself and injured a woman crossing with the signal at Sixth and West 47th. The data logs “driver inexperience.” The woman lived. He did not. It’s all in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>.</p><p>On Feb. 11, 2025, an 83‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal at W 58th and Sixth was hit by a left‑turning SUV. She died. The record shows the turn, the bumper, the age. No comfort. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>entry</a>.</p><p>A week later, Feb. 18, a 67‑year‑old on an e‑bike struck a parked SUV on W 51st at Fifth. He died. Another 67‑year‑old cyclist is logged dead in the same event. Two men. Same age. Same block. The system lists ejections, head trauma, “apparent death.” Read the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>file</a>.</p><h3 id=the-clock-tells-on-this-place>The clock tells on this place</h3><p>The hurt comes in waves. Injuries spike at noon and the long Midtown afternoon, then again after dark. The dead cluster at 3 p.m., 10 p.m., 5 p.m., and 9 p.m. Four deaths at 3 p.m. Three at 10 p.m. One each at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 9 p.m. The hours and counts sit in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city ledger</a>. There is no mystery here. Only time, impact, and loss.</p><h3 id=what-hits-whom>What hits whom</h3><p>Pedestrians: five dead, 448 hurt. Cyclists: three dead, 373 hurt. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage to people on foot. Trucks and buses add their share. The breakdown is blunt and public in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>rollup</a>.</p><p>The official codes point to “inattention/distraction,” bad turns, blown signals. One line towers above the rest: “other.” Nine deaths sit under that word. It explains nothing and says everything. It’s all there in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>factors list</a>.</p><h3 id=corners-that-draw-blood>Corners that draw blood</h3><p>Eight Avenue racks up 25 injuries and four serious cases. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>West 55th Street</a> posts 33 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 47th Street</a> records two deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 58th Street</a> holds one death and a serious injury. These aren’t warnings. They’re receipts.</p><h3 id=what-the-city-says-it-will-fix-elsewhere>What the city says it will fix elsewhere</h3><p>After a driver doing more than 100 mph killed two people at Canal and Bowery, the city promised quick work: barriers, narrower lanes, lower speeds on that corridor. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said the transportation commissioner, in a <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist report</a>. Advocates answered that most of the street “will remain deadly.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>They said it plainly</a>. The same month, NY1 reported the upgrades would follow the crash that killed Kevin Cruickshank and May Kwok. The DA said Kwok sat on a bench. Cruickshank was riding on a sidewalk. Both died. Read the <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1 piece</a>, and the <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-women-indicted-in-deadly-chinatown-crash/>CBS update on indictments</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-the-blocks-we-walk-today>Fix the blocks we walk today</h3><p>We know what helps because we know where and when people are struck. Daylight the corners with clear sight lines. Give walkers a head start at signals. Harden turns at Sixth, Eighth, and the side streets where left turns kill. Focus night enforcement where deaths spike: 9–10 p.m., 3 p.m., and the evening rush. Target the repeat hotspots: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>8th Avenue</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 47th</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>W 58th</a>.</p><h3 id=citywide-brakes-that-save-lives>Citywide brakes that save lives</h3><p>Albany passed a law that lets the city lower speeds. The city can set more 20 mph streets. That is how you dull the blade. The proof sits in the cameras that never sleep. The state renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Now the next step is to slow the worst drivers. A bill in Albany would require <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> for anyone who racks up heavy points or camera tickets. Read our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action page</a> for the calls to make and the numbers behind it.</p><h3 id=no-more-waiting>No more waiting</h3><p>Four deaths in this precinct this year by late August. Injuries up a third over last year’s pace. The hours are known. The corners are known. Lower the speed. Fix the turns. Hold the line at night. Then keep going.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
