A Nissan Rogue hit him. The driver fled. The cyclist was left with severe head trauma, unconscious as paramedics worked to keep him alive. Police arrested the driver two hours later. He was unlicensed. The street was closed, the bike’s red light still flashing in the road. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last year, Precinct 18 saw <strong>6 deaths and 499 injuries</strong> in crashes. <strong>Twelve people were seriously hurt.</strong> The dead include seniors, cyclists, and pedestrians. The numbers do not slow. The city does not slow.</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>The violence is not random. <strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most pain</strong>: 3 deaths, 6 serious injuries, and over 300 injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one, seriously hurt three. Bikes and e-bikes, too, left their mark: 4 serious injuries, dozens more hurt. No one is spared. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h2><p>Local leaders have the tools.

They can target speeding. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can watch the corners where people keep getting hit. They can make it clear: these are not accidents. They are choices.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell the precinct captain you want enforcement, not excuses. Demand safer speeds, safer streets, and real accountability. The blood on the street is not washed away by words. Only action will do.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
