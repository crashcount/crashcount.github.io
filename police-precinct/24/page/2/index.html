Eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last three years, Precinct 24 has seen 1,140 crashes. One hundred five people were hurt in the last year alone. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a child not yet old enough for school. They were walking—crossing with the light or without. They are gone.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three.</strong> Sedans and trucks left bodies broken. Bikes, too, have left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. The dead are children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><h3 id=a-name-not-a-number>A Name, Not a Number</h3><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam at 96th. An ambulance turned left into her path. She died from her wounds. Her husband remembered the moment: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>&ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all.&rdquo;</a> The driver was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The street remains wide, fast, and dangerous.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-power>Leadership: Promises and Power</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. The NYPD can enforce the law. Cameras can catch speeders. Tickets can be written. But the pace is slow. The carnage continues. Each day of delay is another risk, another family shattered.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-24>The Role of Precinct 24</h3><p><strong>Precinct 24 can act.</strong> Officers can target speeding. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can focus on crash hotspots. They can treat traffic violence as the crime it is. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries. The crash exposes the risks of high-speed chases and gaps in police accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
