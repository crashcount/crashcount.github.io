Eleven seriously hurt.</strong> That is the cost in Precinct 24 since 2022. The numbers are cold. The stories are not. In October, a 13-year-old girl was killed crossing Cathedral Parkway. She never made it to the other side. Just weeks later, a 69-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV turning left at 96th and Amsterdam. The street does not forgive mistakes. It does not care about age.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, two people died and six more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The wounded include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most damage.</strong> Three out of five pedestrian deaths here came from SUVs. Trucks, buses, and bikes also hurt people, but the weight of steel and speed is what kills. The numbers do not lie: <a href=../../take_action/>&ldquo;Speed isn&rsquo;t the only factor, but it&rsquo;s the deadliest.&rdquo;</a> A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can enforce the law. But change comes slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> gives the city power to set safer speeds, but the default is still too high. <strong>Speed cameras work, but only where they are installed.</strong></p><p>The police in Precinct 24 can do more. They can crack down on speeding. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement at the worst corners. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
