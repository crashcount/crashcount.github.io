Eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last three years, Precinct 24 has seen 1,140 crashes. One hundred five people were hurt in the last year alone. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a child not yet old enough for school. They were walking—crossing with the light or without. They are gone.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three.</strong> Sedans and trucks left bodies broken. Bikes, too, have left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. The dead are children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><h3 id=a-name-not-a-number>A Name, Not a Number</h3><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam at 96th. An ambulance turned left into her path. She died from her wounds. Her husband remembered the moment: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>&ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all.&rdquo;</a> The driver was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The street remains wide, fast, and dangerous.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-power>Leadership: Promises and Power</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. The NYPD can enforce the law. Cameras can catch speeders. Tickets can be written. But the pace is slow. The carnage continues. Each day of delay is another risk, another family shattered.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-24>The Role of Precinct 24</h3><p><strong>Precinct 24 can act.</strong> Officers can target speeding. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can focus on crash hotspots. They can treat traffic violence as the crime it is. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The impact occurred at the taxi's left front bumper. The pedestrian sustained a head injury, was incoherent, and had minor bleeding. The report lists unspecified contributing factors for the pedestrian but does not cite any driver errors explicitly. The taxi driver was licensed and operating a 2019 Nissan vehicle. The pedestrian was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the report does not assign fault to her. The absence of vehicle damage suggests a low-speed collision. This incident underscores the risks posed by turning vehicles to pedestrians crossing mid-block in Manhattan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
