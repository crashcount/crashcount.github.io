Eleven seriously hurt.</strong> That is the cost in Precinct 24 since 2022. The numbers are cold. The stories are not. In October, a 13-year-old girl was killed crossing Cathedral Parkway. She never made it to the other side. Just weeks later, a 69-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV turning left at 96th and Amsterdam. The street does not forgive mistakes. It does not care about age.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, two people died and six more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The wounded include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most damage.</strong> Three out of five pedestrian deaths here came from SUVs. Trucks, buses, and bikes also hurt people, but the weight of steel and speed is what kills. The numbers do not lie: <a href=../../take_action/>&ldquo;Speed isn&rsquo;t the only factor, but it&rsquo;s the deadliest.&rdquo;</a> A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can enforce the law. But change comes slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> gives the city power to set safer speeds, but the default is still too high. <strong>Speed cameras work, but only where they are installed.</strong></p><p>The police in Precinct 24 can do more. They can crack down on speeding. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement at the worst corners. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Buses crawl now. Riders wait. DOT wants faster trips, safer crossings. Community boards back the plan. Painted lanes, fewer cars, more eyes on the street. Change comes for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 20, 2025, that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has proposed turning 34th Street into a mostly car-free busway, modeled after the 14th Street busway. The plan comes with support from three local community boards. According to the article, 'bus speeds on 14th Street increased by at least 24 percent, and bus ridership grew by 30 percent' after similar changes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes' since the 14th Street redesign. The 34th Street proposal would divert most cars, add painted intersections for visibility, and focus on pedestrian safety. The move targets slow bus speeds—now just 3 mph—and aims to reduce systemic danger for bus riders and people on foot. No driver errors are cited, but the plan addresses longstanding risks from car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The cyclist suffered knee and lower leg injuries, sustaining bruises but remained conscious. The bike was demolished; the truck showed no damage.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred at 1:30 PM on West 104th Street in Manhattan. A pick-up truck, traveling south and making a right turn, collided with a bicyclist going straight east. The bicyclist, a 21-year-old male, was injured with contusions and trauma to the knee, lower leg, and foot. The bike was demolished at the point of impact, while the truck sustained no damage. The report lists no explicit contributing factors for the driver or victim, but the collision during the truck's right turn indicates a failure to yield or inadequate awareness by the driver. The bicyclist was not ejected and remained conscious. No helmet or safety equipment was used by the cyclist, but no police report factors cite this as contributing. The focus remains on the driver's maneuver and the resulting severe impact on the vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
