The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a child not yet old enough for school. They were walking—crossing with the light or without. They are gone.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three.</strong> Sedans and trucks left bodies broken. Bikes, too, have left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age.
