Eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last three years, Precinct 24 has seen 1,140 crashes. One hundred five people were hurt in the last year alone. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a child not yet old enough for school. They were walking—crossing with the light or without. They are gone.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three.</strong> Sedans and trucks left bodies broken. Bikes, too, have left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. The dead are children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><h3 id=a-name-not-a-number>A Name, Not a Number</h3><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam at 96th.

The Council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. The NYPD can enforce the law. Cameras can catch speeders. Tickets can be written. But the pace is slow. The carnage continues. Each day of delay is another risk, another family shattered.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-24>The Role of Precinct 24</h3><p><strong>Precinct 24 can act.</strong> Officers can target speeding.

They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.
