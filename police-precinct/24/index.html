Eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last three years, Precinct 24 has seen 1,140 crashes. One hundred five people were hurt in the last year alone. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a child not yet old enough for school. They were walking—crossing with the light or without. They are gone.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three.</strong> Sedans and trucks left bodies broken. Bikes, too, have left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. The dead are children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><h3 id=a-name-not-a-number>A Name, Not a Number</h3><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam at 96th.

Each day of delay is another risk, another family shattered.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-24>The Role of Precinct 24</h3><p><strong>Precinct 24 can act.</strong> Officers can target speeding.

They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The unicycle, capable of speeds over 40 mph, struck Carolyn Backus, who was riding a standard bike. The unicycle operator was hospitalized in critical but stable condition. NYPD initially charged Backus with leaving the scene, but the charge was dropped. A spokesperson clarified, 'She also remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics.'

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences. The piece underscores the disparity in enforcement and questions the effectiveness and fairness of current NYPD tactics.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers.

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
