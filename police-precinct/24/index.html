Eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last three years, Precinct 24 has seen 1,140 crashes. One hundred five people were hurt in the last year alone. The dead include a 13-year-old girl, a 69-year-old woman, and a child not yet old enough for school. They were walking—crossing with the light or without. They are gone.</p><p><strong>SUVs killed three.</strong> Sedans and trucks left bodies broken. Bikes, too, have left their mark. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. The dead are children, elders, and everyone in between.</p><h3 id=a-name-not-a-number>A Name, Not a Number</h3><p>Miriam Reinharth was crossing Amsterdam at 96th. An ambulance turned left into her path. She died from her wounds.

The street remains wide, fast, and dangerous.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-power>Leadership: Promises and Power</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. The NYPD can enforce the law. Cameras can catch speeders. Tickets can be written. But the pace is slow. The carnage continues. Each day of delay is another risk, another family shattered.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-24>The Role of Precinct 24</h3><p><strong>Precinct 24 can act.</strong> Officers can target speeding. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can focus on crash hotspots. They can treat traffic violence as the crime it is. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The article details how Ruth and Valery Oistenau were knocked down by a cyclist while waiting to cross in the East Village. Their injuries were dismissed by police, reflecting a broader issue: 'Many, possibly most, incidents between bikes of all sorts and pedestrians are not reported.' NYPD policy since 2020 means only the most severe injuries get documented. Mayor Eric Adams stated, 'Bikes must follow the same laws that vehicles follow,' but enforcement and reporting lag behind reality. Dr. Jonathan Kirschner calls for better public-health data, noting, 'the incidence of injuries from encounters between pedestrians and bikes is on the rise.'

The board voted 31-5 in favor. DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent, helping 28,000 daily riders. Supporters called current buses 'painfully slow' and said, 'Time is life!' Others feared diverted cars would 'flood into narrow residential streets.' The plan would force cars to exit 34th quickly or face tickets. The article highlights the tension between improving transit and the risk of increased traffic on side streets, echoing calls for more data and traffic studies before changes roll out.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."
