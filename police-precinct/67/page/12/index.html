Forty seriously injured.</strong> Three years, one precinct. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or excuses. They only rise. In Precinct 67, the dead are not strangers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They are the man crushed crossing Linden Boulevard, the woman struck turning left on Avenue D, the child bleeding on Schenectady Avenue. The street does not forgive. It remembers every name.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unprotected>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unprotected</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths and seven serious injuries came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left bodies broken but did not kill. The sidewalk and the crosswalk offer no shield. The numbers are plain: 548 crashes with cars and SUVs, 40 with trucks and buses, 8 with motorcycles and mopeds, 5 with bikes.

A 68-year-old, killed by a distracted driver. A 30-year-old, dead from a car going too fast. The stories repeat. The grief does not fade. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very heartbroken. He was a good person,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-men-crossing-brooklyn-street/>said Qin Xiao Chen</a>. The pain is not abstract.

They can act now. But action is not a press release. Action is a summons in a driver&rsquo;s hand, a patrol car at the intersection where the last person died. &ldquo;These two deaths are as horrifying as they were preventable,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>said Ben Furnas</a>.
