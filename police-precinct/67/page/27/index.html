The record lists <strong>“Unsafe Speed.”</strong> The man died. The state table shows him as “Crossing Against Signal.” Only one of them is gone.

Injuries crest from the evening into night. The death count climbs too. The city’s hourly ledger shows fatalities peaking at 7 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m., with steady injury surges from the rush into late night, including heavy totals at 5–8 p.m. and after 8 p.m. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>Across modes, people on foot carry the weight: <strong>seven pedestrian deaths</strong>, 628 injured.

Work there now.</p><p>But the pattern is bigger than one corner. <strong>Lower the citywide default to 20 mph</strong> and save lives. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. New York City has the power to set safer speeds. Use it. The case is laid out in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> brief, with sources and contacts.</p><p>The worst repeat speeders do outsized harm.
