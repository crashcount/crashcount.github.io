Add daylighting and hardened turns. Give people a head start at the light. Slow the lanes at night where the injuries rise. Hit the repeat spots until the repeats stop. Target drivers who hurt, at the hours that hurt.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-are-on-the-table>Citywide tools that are on the table</h3><p>Albany renewed the city’s 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. That is one guardrail that held. Our streets still run fast. The city now has the power under Sammy’s Law to drop residential limits to 20 mph. Use it. Repeat speeders kill out of proportion. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the worst drivers to use speed limiters after enough tickets or points. These are the levers.
