So does Linden Boulevard. In Precinct 67, people die trying to cross them.</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>11 people have been killed</strong> on these streets, including <strong>seven pedestrians</strong>. Another 3,700 were hurt. These are NYPD crash records, not rumors.

They are among the top danger spots in the precinct’s own rollup of <a href=#>top intersections</a> and corridors, led by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Church Avenue</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Linden Boulevard</a>.</p><p>On January 25, 2025, at Church Ave and Kings Hwy, a driver going straight hit a 30‑year‑old man in the crosswalk. The record lists <strong>“Unsafe Speed.”</strong> The man died. The state table shows him as “Crossing Against Signal.” Only one of them is gone. This is crash <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4788144</a>.</p><p>On May 14, 2025, at Rutland Rd and E 95 St, a driver turning left struck a 68‑year‑old woman who was <strong>“Crossing With Signal.”</strong> The file reads <strong>“Driver Inattention/Distraction.”</strong> She died at the scene.

Injuries crest from the evening into night. The death count climbs too. The city’s hourly ledger shows fatalities peaking at 7 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m., with steady injury surges from the rush into late night, including heavy totals at 5–8 p.m. and after 8 p.m. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>Across modes, people on foot carry the weight: <strong>seven pedestrian deaths</strong>, 628 injured. Cyclists are hit too: one killed, 235 injured. The vehicles that do most harm to walkers are <strong>sedans and SUVs</strong>, accounting for the vast majority of pedestrian injuries and deaths in this precinct’s rollup.

The data are in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crashes</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Persons</a>.</p><p>A 2011 Ford SUV hit and killed a 36‑year‑old man at Church Ave and E 55 St on July 17, 2025.

Hardened left turns and daylighting at Church Ave and Kings Hwy. Tighten turns and add leading walk time at Rutland Rd and E 95 St. Focus late‑day enforcement where the injuries spike. The precinct’s own map flags <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Church Avenue</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Linden Boulevard</a>. Work there now.</p><p>But the pattern is bigger than one corner. <strong>Lower the citywide default to 20 mph</strong> and save lives. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. New York City has the power to set safer speeds. Use it. The case is laid out in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> brief, with sources and contacts.</p><p>The worst repeat speeders do outsized harm. Mandate intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up camera violations or points, as detailed in <a href=/take_action/>our campaign</a>. It makes the car obey the limit.
