The driver, Miriam Yarimi, was charged after allegedly driving 'nearly double the speed limit,' running a red light, and operating an uninsured, unregistered Audi with a suspended license. Police say Yarimi struck an Uber, flipped, and plowed into the family as they crossed the street. The boy remains in critical condition after losing a kidney. The article quotes City Comptroller Brad Lander: 'He is still in critical condition. He lost one kidney but they are hopeful about his prognosis.' Yarimi faces multiple counts of manslaughter and assault. The crash also injured an Uber driver and a second family.

NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called it "a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The crash left nine injured, including the family's 4-year-old son in critical condition. Both drivers were expected to be tested for drunken driving. Yarimi had not been charged at the time of reporting.

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was struck by a parked Station Wagon/SUV whose tow hitch was defective. The report lists 'Tow Hitch Defective' repeatedly as a contributing factor, indicating mechanical failure played a key role. The pedestrian was located outside an intersection and suffered a fracture and dislocation to her knee, lower leg, and foot, resulting in injury severity level 3. Multiple parked SUVs showed damage consistent with the incident, but no moving vehicle driver errors were cited. The defective tow hitch on the parked vehicle directly contributed to the pedestrian's injury, underscoring systemic dangers posed by poorly maintained vehicle equipment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
