The rider was ejected. The bus was going straight.

These are repeat sites with deaths and serious injuries.</li><li>Daylighting crosswalks removes the blind corners. Hardened left turns slow drivers who cut across people walking. Leading pedestrian intervals give a head start. Targeted night enforcement at these exact blocks hits the hours when bodies fall. These remedies are standard DOT tools.

As the Attorney General said, “the evidence is clear: police vehicle pursuits and high‑speed car chases can be dangerous and even fatal, and it is time for a change.” <a href=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/attorney-general-says-police-chases-mostly-banned-20392396.php>Times Union</a> | <a href=https://apnews.com/article/9aa3cc475f278beed3ba1ecd02d444f7>AP</a>.</li></ul><p>Slow the city, save a life.</p><ul><li>A citywide 20 mph default and speed cameras work together. The city now has the power to lower speeds and Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone cameras. Use both. Our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action page</a> has the steps and contacts.</li><li>The worst repeat speeders do outsized harm. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force chronic offenders to use intelligent speed assistance. Fewer high‑speed impacts means fewer funerals.

Her 4-year-old son remains in critical condition. Police said Yarimi hit another car before mounting the crosswalk. She faces multiple charges, including manslaughter, reckless driving, and unlicensed operation. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called it 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' Assemblyman Michael Novakhov noted Yarimi's 93 violations and $10,000 in unpaid fines. The crash highlights gaps in enforcement and calls for policy changes, such as speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.
