A Mercedes turned left. The car hit her. She died at Kings County Hospital. The driver stayed. There were no charges. The street was quiet again, but the loss stayed behind. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>&ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died</strong> in Precinct 67. <strong>Fourteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nearly a thousand were hurt.

SUVs, motorcycles, and bikes left others broken. In total, there were <strong>1,347 crashes</strong> in the past year. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a> shows the pattern: the same corners, the same mistakes, the same silence.</p><p>The city says it is acting.

The plan is to roll out these changes at high-crash sites. Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue is on the list. The rest wait.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can enforce failure-to-yield. They can target the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safe crossings. Demand action. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
