A 21-year-old female occupant in the SUV, seated in the right rear passenger position and restrained by a lap belt, sustained head injuries and whiplash. She was conscious and not ejected from the vehicle. The driver errors identified focus on vehicle maintenance failure rather than driver behavior. No victim actions were listed as contributing factors in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
