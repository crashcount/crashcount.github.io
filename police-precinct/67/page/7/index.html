Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

The impact caused severe lower limb injuries, highlighting vehicle maintenance failures as a critical factor in pedestrian harm in Brooklyn.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 75-year-old female pedestrian was injured at 4:42 AM in Brooklyn near Church Avenue. The pedestrian was struck by a parked Station Wagon/SUV whose tow hitch was defective. The report lists 'Tow Hitch Defective' repeatedly as a contributing factor, indicating mechanical failure played a key role. The pedestrian was located outside an intersection and suffered a fracture and dislocation to her knee, lower leg, and foot, resulting in injury severity level 3. Multiple parked SUVs showed damage consistent with the incident, but no moving vehicle driver errors were cited. The defective tow hitch on the parked vehicle directly contributed to the pedestrian's injury, underscoring systemic dangers posed by poorly maintained vehicle equipment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
