The report states she was 'crossing with the light' and was in the crosswalk at the time of impact. The collision resulted in fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor on the part of the sedan driver. The vehicle's point of impact was the center front end, matching the narrative of a direct, forceful collision. The victim's behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary cause remains the driver's failure to yield. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard pedestrian right-of-way at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
