SUVs, motorcycles, and bikes left others broken.

The plan is to roll out these changes at high-crash sites. Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue is on the list. The rest wait.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can enforce failure-to-yield. They can target the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safe crossings. Demand action.
