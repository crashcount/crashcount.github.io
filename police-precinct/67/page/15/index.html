It comes with broken bodies and empty chairs. <strong>Nine people have died on these streets since 2022. Forty more have been seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, four lives were lost and over a thousand people were hurt. These numbers are not just statistics—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. A 68-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at E 95th and Rutland, was killed by a turning sedan. A 74-year-old woman, struck at Avenue D and New York Avenue, never made it home. The dead do not get a second chance. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Four deaths. Hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death is carried by the largest machines. The pattern is clear. The risk is not random. It is built into the streets and the rules that govern them.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-action-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Action, and Silence</h3><p>The city has the tools: speed cameras, lower speed limits, new laws. But in Precinct 67, the pace of change is slow. Police can enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act. The dead cannot wait for another study.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;One traffic fatality is one too many,&rdquo;</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/914-23/mayor-adams-launches-new-effort-make-thousands-nyc-intersections-safer-of-broad-new#:~:text=%E2%80%9COne%20traffic%20fatality%20is%20one,%E2%80%9D">said Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi</a>, promising to use &ldquo;every lever&mldr;to ensure that New Yorkers are safe however they choose to get around.&rdquo;</p><p>But promises do not stop cars. <strong>&ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo;</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

The crash occurred at 19:47, with both victims—aged 23 and 26—suffering severe lacerations and partial ejection from the scooter. The report states, 'A Lexus struck an e-scooter carrying two men. No helmets. Both thrown, torn, bleeding. Steel met flesh. Skin split open.' Both men were conscious but badly injured, left broken across the road. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The sedan driver, licensed in New York, was traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary failure remains with the distracted driver. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers lose focus behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
