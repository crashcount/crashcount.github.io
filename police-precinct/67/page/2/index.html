It comes with broken bodies and empty chairs. <strong>Nine people have died on these streets since 2022. Forty more have been seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, four lives were lost and over a thousand people were hurt. These numbers are not just statistics—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. A 68-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at E 95th and Rutland, was killed by a turning sedan. A 74-year-old woman, struck at Avenue D and New York Avenue, never made it home. The dead do not get a second chance. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Four deaths. Hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death is carried by the largest machines. The pattern is clear. The risk is not random. It is built into the streets and the rules that govern them.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-action-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Action, and Silence</h3><p>The city has the tools: speed cameras, lower speed limits, new laws. But in Precinct 67, the pace of change is slow. Police can enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act. The dead cannot wait for another study.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;One traffic fatality is one too many,&rdquo;</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/914-23/mayor-adams-launches-new-effort-make-thousands-nyc-intersections-safer-of-broad-new#:~:text=%E2%80%9COne%20traffic%20fatality%20is%20one,%E2%80%9D">said Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi</a>, promising to use &ldquo;every lever&mldr;to ensure that New Yorkers are safe however they choose to get around.&rdquo;</p><p>But promises do not stop cars. <strong>&ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo;</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Bus lanes and pedestrian islands will take their place. Fifty-five killed or badly hurt since 2019. Buses crawl. Pedestrians dodge traffic. The city moves to fix a deadly, clogged corridor.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 4, 2025, that New York City's Department of Transportation plans to overhaul Flatbush Avenue between Livingston Street and Grand Army Plaza. The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
