Forty left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,300 hurt since 2022. Each number is a body, a family, a life split open by speed and steel. The dead do not speak. Their absence does.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> Four deaths, hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars. The street does not care who you are. It only cares if you are in the way.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-pattern-never-breaks>Recent Crashes: The Pattern Never Breaks</h3><p>The pain is not old news. Just this spring, a woman crossing with the signal at Rutland Road and E 95th Street was killed by a turning sedan. She was 68. The driver was distracted. She had the light. She died anyway. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A few months before, a 74-year-old woman was struck and killed at Avenue D and New York Avenue.

The danger is not hidden.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, more daylighted intersections, and real enforcement. They can fight for laws that protect people, not just cars. But every day of delay is another day of risk. <strong>&ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo;</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.
