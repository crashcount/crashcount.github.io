It comes with broken bodies and empty chairs. <strong>Nine people have died on these streets since 2022. Forty more have been seriously injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, four lives were lost and over a thousand people were hurt. These numbers are not just statistics—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. A 68-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at E 95th and Rutland, was killed by a turning sedan. A 74-year-old woman, struck at Avenue D and New York Avenue, never made it home. The dead do not get a second chance. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>)</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Four deaths. Hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death is carried by the largest machines. The pattern is clear. The risk is not random. It is built into the streets and the rules that govern them.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-action-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Action, and Silence</h3><p>The city has the tools: speed cameras, lower speed limits, new laws. But in Precinct 67, the pace of change is slow. Police can enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act. The dead cannot wait for another study.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;One traffic fatality is one too many,&rdquo;</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/914-23/mayor-adams-launches-new-effort-make-thousands-nyc-intersections-safer-of-broad-new#:~:text=%E2%80%9COne%20traffic%20fatality%20is%20one,%E2%80%9D">said Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi</a>, promising to use &ldquo;every lever&mldr;to ensure that New Yorkers are safe however they choose to get around.&rdquo;</p><p>But promises do not stop cars. <strong>&ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo;</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
