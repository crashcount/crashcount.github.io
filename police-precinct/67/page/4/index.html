In total, there were <strong>1,347 crashes</strong> in the past year. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a> shows the pattern: the same corners, the same mistakes, the same silence.</p><p>The city says it is acting. The Department of Transportation promises new barriers at intersections. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>said Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The plan is to roll out these changes at high-crash sites. Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue is on the list. The rest wait.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can enforce failure-to-yield. They can target the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safe crossings. Demand action. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene; no arrests were made as the investigation continued. The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves.
