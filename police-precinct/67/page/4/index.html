Injuries crest from the evening into night. The death count climbs too. The city’s hourly ledger shows fatalities peaking at 7 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m., with steady injury surges from the rush into late night, including heavy totals at 5–8 p.m. and after 8 p.m. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>Across modes, people on foot carry the weight: <strong>seven pedestrian deaths</strong>, 628 injured.

Work there now.</p><p>But the pattern is bigger than one corner. <strong>Lower the citywide default to 20 mph</strong> and save lives. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. New York City has the power to set safer speeds. Use it. The case is laid out in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> brief, with sources and contacts.</p><p>The worst repeat speeders do outsized harm.
