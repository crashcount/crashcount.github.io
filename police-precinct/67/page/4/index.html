Since 2022, nine people have died in crashes. Forty people have suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. Most of the dead were walking. Some were old. Some were young. None of them came home.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a woman, age 68, was killed crossing Rutland Road. The driver was turning left. She had the signal. The driver did not see her. The report lists only: &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A year before, a 74-year-old woman was killed on Avenue D. She was crossing with the light. The car turned left and took her life. The record is silent about the driver. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-rest>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Rest</h3><p>Cars and SUVs caused the most harm: 4 deaths, 389 minor injuries, 135 moderate, 7 serious. Trucks and buses killed 2. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0 deaths, but 6 injuries. Bikes, 0 deaths, 5 injuries. The street is not equal. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The police in Precinct 67 have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can target the corners where people die. But the record shows the dying goes on.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, for daylighting intersections, for more enforcement where it matters. But every day of delay is another day of risk. The numbers do not lie. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said a witness after a recent crash</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Every day you wait is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Yarimi was charged with manslaughter, reckless driving, and other offenses. The Audi she drove had a record of 99 violations, including red-light and school-zone speeding tickets. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road."

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
