Forty seriously injured.</strong> Over 3,300 hurt since 2022. Each number is a body on the street, a family left waiting for someone who will not come home. The dead are not just numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors.</p><p>Just this May, a woman, 68, was crossing with the signal at Rutland Road and E 95th Street. A sedan turned left. She died there, chest crushed. The cause: driver inattention. No storm, no darkness—just a driver who did not see, or did not care. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Earlier this year, a 30-year-old man was killed at Church Avenue and Kings Highway. The car was speeding. He crossed against the light. Only one person died. The car kept going. The street stayed open.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths, hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses take more. Motorcycles and mopeds leave bodies and broken bones. Bikes, too, but the toll is smaller—no deaths, a handful of injuries.</p><p>The stories repeat. A truck on Linden Boulevard. A sedan on Avenue D. A moped, a mask, a man left bleeding in the crosswalk. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The driver left. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has new laws. Speed cameras. Lower limits. But in Precinct 67, the blood keeps flowing. The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless turns, target the corners where people die. They know the hotspots. They know the hours. They just need to act.</p><p>Some leaders call for more. &ldquo;If we would require any vehicles, any motorized vehicles, moving over a speed of 25 mph to be registered, to be insured, it would be much easier to find,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Assemblyman Michael Novakhov</a>. But words are not enough. The dead do not care about speeches.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The police can enforce the law. The city can redesign the streets. The council can lower the speed limit. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
