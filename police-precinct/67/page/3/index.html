Forty seriously injured.</strong> Three years, one precinct. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or excuses. They only rise. In Precinct 67, the dead are not strangers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They are the man crushed crossing Linden Boulevard, the woman struck turning left on Avenue D, the child bleeding on Schenectady Avenue. The street does not forgive. It remembers every name.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unprotected>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unprotected</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths and seven serious injuries came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left bodies broken but did not kill. The sidewalk and the crosswalk offer no shield. The numbers are plain: 548 crashes with cars and SUVs, 40 with trucks and buses, 8 with motorcycles and mopeds, 5 with bikes.

A 68-year-old, killed by a distracted driver. A 30-year-old, dead from a car going too fast. The stories repeat. The grief does not fade. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very heartbroken. He was a good person,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-men-crossing-brooklyn-street/>said Qin Xiao Chen</a>. The pain is not abstract.

They can act now. But action is not a press release. Action is a summons in a driver&rsquo;s hand, a patrol car at the intersection where the last person died. &ldquo;These two deaths are as horrifying as they were preventable,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>said Ben Furnas</a>.

Officers, following new NYPD pursuit rules, did not chase but instead set a roadblock. According to NYPD Chief John Chell, 'We didn't pursue the vehicle, we strategically radioed ahead to shut down traffic.' The driver, Jumaane Wright, swerved toward officers, nearly striking a lieutenant, who fired a single shot. Wright crashed a mile later and died at the hospital. The Attorney General's investigation is standard for such incidents. The case highlights risks in high-speed police interventions and the ongoing challenge of balancing pursuit policies with public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police say Brod had the light. The driver, Menachem Shagalow, 65, was unlicensed and charged with aggravated unlicensed operation and failure to exercise due care. The article quotes Brod's grandson: "She was extremely independent till her last day." Brod died less than two weeks after the crash. The incident highlights ongoing risks for pedestrians, especially from unlicensed drivers. Shagalow was released with a desk appearance ticket.
