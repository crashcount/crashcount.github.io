After the initial crash, the Chevy Trax driver struck the woman as she exited her vehicle, then drove against traffic on Lafayette Ave., hitting two parked cars before fleeing on foot. Witness Shane Bridges described, "They dragged her like to the middle of the street, and then they turned wrong up Lafayette and she was just left there." The SUV had temporary paper plates. The incident highlights the dangers posed by reckless driving and hit-and-run behavior, especially when drivers ignore traffic direction and abandon crash scenes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
