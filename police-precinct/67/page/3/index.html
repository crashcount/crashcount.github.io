The victims, a man and a woman, "couldn't even see [the string] until it was too late." The man required hospitalization; the woman was also hurt. The article highlights the hidden danger posed by objects left or strung across public walkways. No mention is made of driver involvement, but the incident underscores the need for better oversight of bridge safety and the removal of hazardous obstacles.
