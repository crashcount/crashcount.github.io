Forty seriously injured.</strong> Three years, one precinct. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or excuses. They only rise. In Precinct 67, the dead are not strangers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They are the man crushed crossing Linden Boulevard, the woman struck turning left on Avenue D, the child bleeding on Schenectady Avenue. The street does not forgive. It remembers every name.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unprotected>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unprotected</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths and seven serious injuries came from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left bodies broken but did not kill. The sidewalk and the crosswalk offer no shield. The numbers are plain: 548 crashes with cars and SUVs, 40 with trucks and buses, 8 with motorcycles and mopeds, 5 with bikes.

A 68-year-old, killed by a distracted driver. A 30-year-old, dead from a car going too fast. The stories repeat. The grief does not fade. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very heartbroken. He was a good person,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-men-crossing-brooklyn-street/>said Qin Xiao Chen</a>. The pain is not abstract.

They can act now. But action is not a press release. Action is a summons in a driver&rsquo;s hand, a patrol car at the intersection where the last person died. &ldquo;These two deaths are as horrifying as they were preventable,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>said Ben Furnas</a>.

The city’s own Department of Transportation found the protected lane cut crashes and injuries by 47 percent, but the judge called the change 'only a modification.' She wrote, 'Modification of the bike lane is not a major transportation project.' Critics, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, say the removal endangers vulnerable road users and bypasses public input. The decision highlights gaps in notification laws and the risk of reverting to unprotected lanes on a Vision Zero priority corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Barriers, granite, planters—hard lines drawn. Sightlines open. Pedestrians and cyclists step forward, visible. Intersections, once blind, now clear. The city moves to cut the toll where most blood spills.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 11, 2025, that the NYC Department of Transportation will redesign intersections to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop vehicles from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections. The new design will first appear at high-crash sites in Brooklyn, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue and several others. The move highlights a systemic effort to address visibility failures and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
