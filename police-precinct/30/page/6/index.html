The victim suffered severe head injuries and was found semiconscious, lying on the cold asphalt with blood pooling beneath a flickering streetlight. The crash occurred away from any intersection or crosswalk, with the vehicle’s center front end striking the pedestrian directly. The police report does not list any driver errors or contributing factors, nor does it indicate any victim behaviors as factors. The absence of safe crossing infrastructure and the direct collision highlight systemic dangers faced by pedestrians in this area.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
