A cyclist rides home at dusk. The engine noise is the last thing they hear. In Precinct 30, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Three people have died. Five more suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one death, four serious injuries, 162 hurt</strong>—all within a few square miles. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry it forever.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> An SUV struck a cyclist on St. Nicholas Avenue. A sedan hit a pedestrian at Broadway and West 143rd. A van turned into a moped on St. Nicholas. The list is long. The pain is silent. The street remembers every name, even if the city forgets.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit stays high. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> The law that keeps them running is set to expire again. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target crash hotspots. But action is not a press release. It is a summons, a checkpoint, a patrol car parked where the crashes happen.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>The families wait for answers. Some get a bill from the city for a broken police car. Some get nothing at all. After a deadly police pursuit, the family of Samuel Williams <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/23/dirt-bikers-family-demands-attorney-general-charge-nypd-cop-deadly-uptown-collision/>demanded justice</a>. The city sent them an invoice. The NYPD stayed silent, citing litigation. The attorney called it a &ldquo;deadly maneuver&rdquo; for a minor violation <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/23/dirt-bikers-family-demands-attorney-general-charge-nypd-cop-deadly-uptown-collision/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of blood on the street.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. Demand that every crash is treated as a crime scene, not a cost of doing business. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
