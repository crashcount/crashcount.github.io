A cyclist rides home at dusk. The engine noise is the last thing they hear. In Precinct 30, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Three people have died. Five more suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one death, four serious injuries, 162 hurt</strong>—all within a few square miles. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry it forever.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> An SUV struck a cyclist on St. Nicholas Avenue. A sedan hit a pedestrian at Broadway and West 143rd. A van turned into a moped on St. Nicholas. The list is long. The pain is silent. The street remembers every name, even if the city forgets.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit stays high. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> The law that keeps them running is set to expire again. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a life.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target crash hotspots. But action is not a press release. It is a summons, a checkpoint, a patrol car parked where the crashes happen.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>The families wait for answers. Some get a bill from the city for a broken police car. Some get nothing at all. After a deadly police pursuit, the family of Samuel Williams <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/23/dirt-bikers-family-demands-attorney-general-charge-nypd-cop-deadly-uptown-collision/>demanded justice</a>. The city sent them an invoice. The NYPD stayed silent, citing litigation. The attorney called it a &ldquo;deadly maneuver&rdquo; for a minor violation <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/23/dirt-bikers-family-demands-attorney-general-charge-nypd-cop-deadly-uptown-collision/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of blood on the street.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. Demand that every crash is treated as a crime scene, not a cost of doing business. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries.
