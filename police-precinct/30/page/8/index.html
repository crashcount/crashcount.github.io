The report identifies 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor, indicating the driver's limited visibility played a critical role in the crash. The point of impact was the vehicle's left front bumper. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally, but the failure to ensure a clear view before turning led to the collision.
