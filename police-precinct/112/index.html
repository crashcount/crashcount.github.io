Nine seriously hurt.</strong> In the past twelve months, Precinct 112 has seen two deaths and four serious injuries. Since 2022, five have been killed and 1,113 injured. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. A 55-year-old man on a motorcycle, crushed and burned on Woodhaven Boulevard. A 23-year-old cyclist, struck and left dead on Queens Boulevard. The dead do not speak. Their absence does.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>William McField, 55, died in flames after a BMW SUV rear-ended his motorcycle. His son, Jayden, said his father <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-road-rage-crash-42-year-old-suspect-allegedly-killed-motorcyclist-long-island-expressway-turns-himself/16249001/>&ldquo;was very beloved in the community and true to his friends and family&rdquo;</a>. The Queens District Attorney put it plain: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. The power to enforce. But the carnage continues. Police can crack down on reckless driving, target crash hotspots, and issue tickets for speeding and failure to yield. They can act—if they choose to see the problem. The law now allows the city to set safer speed limits, but action lags. Each delay is another risk, another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Residents must demand more from their leaders and their precinct. Call for real enforcement. Call for safer streets. Call for action before another name becomes a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses. The legal fight spotlights tension between safety improvements and business concerns, as the corridor ranks among Queens' most crash-prone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The teen, unlicensed and speeding at over 100 mph in a 30-mph zone, lost control and struck a parked UPS truck. Prosecutors said he only had a learner's permit and had been previously ticketed for unlicensed driving. His parents, who gave him the BMW, were convicted of child endangerment.
