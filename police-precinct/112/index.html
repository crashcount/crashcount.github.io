Since 2022, there have been <strong>2,670 crashes</strong>, leaving <strong>1,314 people hurt</strong> and <strong>5 dead</strong>. Pedestrians took 262 injuries and 2 deaths; cyclists 95 injuries and 1 death. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Trucks and buses added more wounds. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a>.</p><h3 id=lie-and-grand-central-where-the-toll-is-paid>L.I.E. and Grand Central: where the toll is paid</h3><p>The <strong>Long Island Expressway</strong> is the top killer here: <strong>2 deaths</strong> and 134 injuries tied to that corridor. The <strong>Grand Central Parkway</strong> follows with <strong>1 death</strong> and 183 injuries. Even <strong>Queens Boulevard</strong> still maims: <strong>95 injuries</strong>. These are the places where speed rules and people bleed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 22‑year‑old motorcyclist died on the L.I.E. after contact with a tractor trailer. NYPD recorded “Unsafe Speed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4632739</a>.

From midnight to 4 a.m., the precinct logged three deaths and 155 injuries. Another spike comes around the morning rush and noon. The clock does not care; the body count grows. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>SUVs and sedans hit most pedestrians here: 196 injured and <strong>2 killed</strong>.

Vulnerable road users took blame in a smaller slice, but they are the ones left broken: 44 injuries and 2 deaths noted under that category. Improper passing, distraction, and failure to yield keep showing up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Contributing factors</a>.</p><p>On a Queens highway, a wrong‑way driver admitted he “wanted to hurt people.” Two motorists were badly hurt. A judge gave him eight years. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,”</a> the Queens DA said.</p><p>Near JFK, a driver hit a 52‑year‑old man crossing before sunrise and fled. “The driver sped off without stopping,” police said. He died at Jamaica Hospital.
