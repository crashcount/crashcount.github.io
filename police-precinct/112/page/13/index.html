Nine seriously hurt.</strong> In the past twelve months, Precinct 112 has seen two deaths and four serious injuries. Since 2022, five have been killed and 1,113 injured. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. A 55-year-old man on a motorcycle, crushed and burned on Woodhaven Boulevard. A 23-year-old cyclist, struck and left dead on Queens Boulevard. The dead do not speak. Their absence does.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>William McField, 55, died in flames after a BMW SUV rear-ended his motorcycle. His son, Jayden, said his father <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-road-rage-crash-42-year-old-suspect-allegedly-killed-motorcyclist-long-island-expressway-turns-himself/16249001/>&ldquo;was very beloved in the community and true to his friends and family&rdquo;</a>. The Queens District Attorney put it plain: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. The power to enforce. But the carnage continues. Police can crack down on reckless driving, target crash hotspots, and issue tickets for speeding and failure to yield. They can act—if they choose to see the problem. The law now allows the city to set safer speed limits, but action lags. Each delay is another risk, another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Residents must demand more from their leaders and their precinct. Call for real enforcement. Call for safer streets. Call for action before another name becomes a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
