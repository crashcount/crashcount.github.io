Nine seriously hurt.</strong> In the past twelve months, Precinct 112 has seen two deaths and four serious injuries. Since 2022, five have been killed and 1,113 injured. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. A 55-year-old man on a motorcycle, crushed and burned on Woodhaven Boulevard. A 23-year-old cyclist, struck and left dead on Queens Boulevard. The dead do not speak. Their absence does.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>William McField, 55, died in flames after a BMW SUV rear-ended his motorcycle. His son, Jayden, said his father <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-road-rage-crash-42-year-old-suspect-allegedly-killed-motorcyclist-long-island-expressway-turns-himself/16249001/>&ldquo;was very beloved in the community and true to his friends and family&rdquo;</a>. The Queens District Attorney put it plain: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. The power to enforce. But the carnage continues. Police can crack down on reckless driving, target crash hotspots, and issue tickets for speeding and failure to yield. They can act—if they choose to see the problem. The law now allows the city to set safer speed limits, but action lags. Each delay is another risk, another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Residents must demand more from their leaders and their precinct. Call for real enforcement. Call for safer streets. Call for action before another name becomes a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He struck a young airport worker heading to his job. The crash killed the worker. The driver was drunk, high, and going 83 in a 25 zone. He faces manslaughter charges.</p><p class=mb3>According to NY Daily News (March 28, 2025), probationary firefighter Michael Pena was fired after being charged with vehicular manslaughter for a deadly crash on February 26. Prosecutors say Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly twice the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article notes, 'Police charged Pena with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing to take a breath test.' Surveillance footage confirmed Pena had been drinking for hours before the crash. The incident highlights the lethal consequences of impaired, reckless driving and raises questions about screening and accountability for city employees operating vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The girl was crossing with the light when the right front bumper hit her leg, causing severe lacerations and significant bleeding. The report states, 'The driver never saw her.' The contributing factor listed is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The pedestrian's actions—crossing with the signal at the intersection—are noted, but the primary cause identified is the bus driver's failure to pay attention while turning. No vehicle damage was reported. The incident underscores the danger posed by inattentive driving, especially when large vehicles turn through crosswalks occupied by people with the right of way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
