Since 2022, there have been <strong>2,670 crashes</strong>, leaving <strong>1,314 people hurt</strong> and <strong>5 dead</strong>. Pedestrians took 262 injuries and 2 deaths; cyclists 95 injuries and 1 death. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Trucks and buses added more wounds. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a>.</p><h3 id=lie-and-grand-central-where-the-toll-is-paid>L.I.E. and Grand Central: where the toll is paid</h3><p>The <strong>Long Island Expressway</strong> is the top killer here: <strong>2 deaths</strong> and 134 injuries tied to that corridor. The <strong>Grand Central Parkway</strong> follows with <strong>1 death</strong> and 183 injuries. Even <strong>Queens Boulevard</strong> still maims: <strong>95 injuries</strong>. These are the places where speed rules and people bleed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 22‑year‑old motorcyclist died on the L.I.E. after contact with a tractor trailer. NYPD recorded “Unsafe Speed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4632739</a>.

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The girl was crossing with the light when the right front bumper hit her leg, causing severe lacerations and significant bleeding. The report states, 'The driver never saw her.' The contributing factor listed is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The pedestrian's actions—crossing with the signal at the intersection—are noted, but the primary cause identified is the bus driver's failure to pay attention while turning. No vehicle damage was reported. The incident underscores the danger posed by inattentive driving, especially when large vehicles turn through crosswalks occupied by people with the right of way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

He slammed into Justin Diaz’s car. Diaz died. He was 23. His family buried him with his new degree. The firefighter faces charges. The street remains unchanged.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (2025-03-04), Justin Diaz, 23, was killed when an off-duty FDNY firefighter, Michael Pena, sped through a red light at 83 mph in a 25 mph zone and struck Diaz’s BMW at 107th St. and Northern Blvd. Diaz was heading to work at LaGuardia Airport. Prosecutors say Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and refused a breath test. His blood-alcohol content was 0.156 percent. Surveillance footage confirmed Diaz had the right-of-way. The article notes, 'The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.' Pena was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. His license was suspended. The case highlights ongoing dangers for New York City road users and questions about bail and accountability for reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
