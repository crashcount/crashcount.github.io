Another, 62, struck by an SUV at 3rd and 122nd. A 66-year-old, dead on 5th Avenue. A woman, 32, killed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. Five dead in Precinct 25 since 2022. <strong>Four were pedestrians.

Trucks killed one.</strong> Buses, bikes, and e-bikes left others bleeding, but the big machines do most of the damage. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone who walks.

It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.”</p><p><strong>The paths are dark. The crossings are wide.

The point of impact was the taxi’s center front end, yet the vehicle sustained no damage. The pedestrian was conscious but suffered contusions and bruising to the shoulder and upper arm, classified as injury severity level 3. The report notes alcohol involvement as a contributing factor for the pedestrian but does not list any driver contributing factors explicitly. However, the driver’s action of making a left turn into a pedestrian crossing with the signal indicates a failure to yield right of way. The taxi driver was licensed and operating a 2014 Toyota vehicle with one occupant. This crash highlights the systemic danger posed by vehicle turns at intersections even when pedestrians follow crossing signals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
