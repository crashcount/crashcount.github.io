Another, 62, struck by an SUV at 3rd and 122nd. A 66-year-old, dead on 5th Avenue. A woman, 32, killed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. Five dead in Precinct 25 since 2022. <strong>Four were pedestrians.

It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.”</p><p><strong>The paths are dark. The crossings are wide.
