Another, 62, struck by an SUV at 3rd and 122nd. A 66-year-old, dead on 5th Avenue. A woman, 32, killed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. Five dead in Precinct 25 since 2022. <strong>Four were pedestrians. One was crossing at a marked crosswalk.</strong></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 2 people died and 3 suffered serious injuries in 700 crashes.</strong> There were 365 injuries.

Trucks killed one.</strong> Buses, bikes, and e-bikes left others bleeding, but the big machines do most of the damage. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone who walks.

Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>said</a>: “We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.”</p><p><strong>The paths are dark. The crossings are wide.
