Another, 62, struck by an SUV at 3rd and 122nd. A 66-year-old, dead on 5th Avenue. A woman, 32, killed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. Five dead in Precinct 25 since 2022. <strong>Four were pedestrians. One was crossing at a marked crosswalk.</strong></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 2 people died and 3 suffered serious injuries in 700 crashes.</strong> There were 365 injuries.

Trucks killed one.</strong> Buses, bikes, and e-bikes left others bleeding, but the big machines do most of the damage. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone who walks.

Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>said</a>: “We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.”</p><p><strong>The paths are dark. The crossings are wide.

The article states, “A wrong-way driver fleeing from police struck a bicyclist in Greenwich Village during a chase.” The suspect, pursued on foot by officers, entered a black sedan and hit the cyclist before escaping. Emergency services brought the 44-year-old victim to Bellevue Hospital; he survived. The suspect remains at large. The piece notes a sharp rise in injuries from police pursuits: 398 crashes and 315 injuries in the first eleven months of 2024, up 47% from the previous year. The NYPD is revising its pursuit policy after ten deaths in cases where “no drugs or guns were found.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
