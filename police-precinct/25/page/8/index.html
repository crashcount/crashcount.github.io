Another, 62, struck by an SUV at 3rd and 122nd. A 66-year-old, dead on 5th Avenue. A woman, 32, killed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. Five dead in Precinct 25 since 2022. <strong>Four were pedestrians. One was crossing at a marked crosswalk.</strong></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 2 people died and 3 suffered serious injuries in 700 crashes.</strong> There were 365 injuries.

Trucks killed one.</strong> Buses, bikes, and e-bikes left others bleeding, but the big machines do most of the damage. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone who walks. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies. They are families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><h3 id=the-gaps-in-protection>The Gaps in Protection</h3><p>On Randall’s Island, a woman riding home on her e-bike was beaten and left for dead. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>said</a>: “We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.”</p><p><strong>The paths are dark. The crossings are wide.

The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands. The cameras that catch speeders work, but their future is always in question. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement.
