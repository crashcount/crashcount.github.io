Another, 62, struck by an SUV at 3rd and 122nd. A 66-year-old, dead on 5th Avenue. A woman, 32, killed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. Five dead in Precinct 25 since 2022. <strong>Four were pedestrians. One was crossing at a marked crosswalk.</strong></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 2 people died and 3 suffered serious injuries in 700 crashes.</strong> There were 365 injuries.

Trucks killed one.</strong> Buses, bikes, and e-bikes left others bleeding, but the big machines do most of the damage. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone who walks. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies. They are families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><h3 id=the-gaps-in-protection>The Gaps in Protection</h3><p>On Randall’s Island, a woman riding home on her e-bike was beaten and left for dead. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>said</a>: “We need more protection, we need more lights. It is ridiculous that the park that my mom would ride from to go from work to home had no lights and no cameras.”</p><p><strong>The paths are dark. The crossings are wide.

Cyclists using the Hudson River greenway must share space with highway-bound vehicles. The $150-million project includes only a painted, unprotected lane. DOT official Colleen Chattergoon said, "With the space that we have, we cannot accommodate a protected bike lane in that area." The city has not acted on a 2019 resolution calling for real protection. Community members and advocates question the safety of the design, especially for children. Officials promised to review the resolution but gave no timeline or details. The plan leaves cyclists exposed to fast-moving traffic, highlighting ongoing policy gaps in street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents fear traffic will flood side streets. Bus riders crawl at five miles an hour. Officials tout safety gains from 14th Street. Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Security video shows the pursued SUV crashing and catching fire at Dyckman Street. Officers arrived seconds later but did not stop, instead driving away as flames grew. Guzman Parra died in the fire. The article quotes Guzman's sister: "No help was offered, and then how long he burned for." Officers were suspended after the incident.
