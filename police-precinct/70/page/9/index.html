The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>On Avenue L, a 73-year-old woman was crossing with the signal. An SUV turned right. She never made it to the other side.

The wounded carry scars.</p><p>Speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving are not mysteries. They are choices. The precinct can crack down. They can ticket. They can target the corners where people die. They can make it stop.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safer crossings. Demand that the city use the power it has.
