They do not make it home. A driver with 93 violations and a suspended license barrels through, flips her car, and leaves three dead, a family broken, and another family scarred. The boy who survived now lives with pain and fear. His mother sinks into depression. His sister’s head aches. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>Shakhzod described ongoing back pain and fears of another accident.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 664 were injured</strong> in Precinct 70.

Four killed by SUVs, one by a sedan, one by a truck. Buses and bikes take their share. The street is a gauntlet. The curb is no refuge. A school bus jumps the sidewalk at Bedford and Farragut, smashing a fence, sending an eight-year-old boy and his mother to the hospital. The bus was waiting for a pedestrian. Then it leapt forward. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>&ldquo;The bus was waiting because a pedestrian was in front of the school bus and all of a sudden we heard a boom.

She <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>says, &ldquo;We do know we need more traffic safety in this area.&rdquo;</a> The words are true. The action is slow. The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless turns, target the corners where people die. They can make the numbers fall. But the numbers do not fall fast enough.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of blood on the street. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand slower speeds.
