The toll mounts. Since 2022, Precinct 70 has recorded <strong>9 pedestrians killed</strong> and <strong>2 cyclists killed</strong>. Another 2 people riding e‑devices are dead. Injuries run into the thousands. The map keeps filling in red, not ink but lives. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> shows it.</p><h3 id=flatbush-ave-takes-the-hits>Flatbush Ave takes the hits</h3><p>One corridor tops the list. <a href=#>Flatbush Avenue</a> has the most injuries in the precinct and at least one death since 2022, per the city’s crash files. A 73‑year‑old woman was struck in the crosswalk at Avenue L and E 12th by a turning Jeep and died at the scene, the city dataset shows (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue L/E 12th crash</a>). On Avenue O, a 47‑year‑old man on a bike collided with a Kia SUV and died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>March 13, 2024</a>). At Tilden and Bedford, a dump truck turning right hit a woman who was crossing with the signal. She did not survive (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>March 7, 2024</a>).</p><p>Trucks and buses are few here, but when they hit, they kill. Since 2022, heavy vehicles account for fewer crashes than cars, yet they are tied to multiple pedestrian deaths in the city files. The harm is plain in the records.</p><h3 id=when-the-day-turns-people-die>When the day turns, people die</h3><p>The danger rises in late afternoon and early evening. The city’s hour‑by‑hour counts show the heaviest death load from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. and again around 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., with injuries peaking from school let‑out to rush hour (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>). Parents pushing strollers. Teens walking home. The street gives no quarter.</p><p>Contributing factors tell the same story. Most cases land in “other” or go unspecified. But failures that matter for people on foot and bike — distraction, failure to yield, and bad turns — recur in the ledger, with over a thousand injuries tied to that murk and those mistakes, according to the precinct roll‑up from the city data.</p><h3 id=names-missing-the-pattern-isnt>Names missing. The pattern isn’t.</h3><p>A 64‑year‑old man died at Flatbush and Caton, struck by an Audi sedan while in the roadway, not at an intersection (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Dec. 31, 2024</a>). The record for Tilden and Bedford says the truck failed to yield and was oversized. The woman was “crossing with signal.” That is the line in the file. It is enough (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Mar. 7, 2024</a>).</p><p>Coney Island Avenue shows up again and again in the precinct logs with injuries and serious injuries. Ocean Avenue, too. The top‑location list is a ledger of pain, not theory. The city keeps the count.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one?</h3><p>Here are fixes that match the crash types logged here:</p><ul><li>Hardened right turns and leading pedestrian intervals at the turns that kill: Tilden/Bedford, Avenue L/E 12th, and along <a href=#>Flatbush Avenue</a>.</li><li>Daylighting and no‑standing at corners across <a href=#>Ocean Avenue</a> and Coney Island Avenue to clear sightlines the data says drivers need.</li><li>Truck routing and targeted enforcement during the fatal hours to keep oversized vehicles off narrow turns.</li></ul><p>These are not abstractions. They are answers to the lines in the crash sheets.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-were-owed-right-now>Citywide tools we’re owed right now</h3><p>Speed is the knife. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. New York City now has the power to set a lower default speed. Advocates point to it. Our own reporting lays out the case to drop the limit and slow the fleet. See our guide and demand action: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>And the repeat offenders. A tiny pool of drivers racks up camera tickets and harm. The Stop Super Speeders bill would force the worst to install speed limiters. The evidence on repeat speeding is already public, and the families here know what it costs. Call your legislators. Ask for the limiter and the lower limit. It is the straightest line from this precinct’s dead to fewer funerals.</p><p>“Criminal charges for him were still pending,” police told <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a> after one Brooklyn crash that killed a moped rider. The bureaucratic words sit next to the loss. They always do.</p><p>—</p><p>One more block. One more turn. The file grows. Lower speeds. Fewer right‑hook deaths. Fewer families waiting on a body ID.

Barriers, granite, planters will clear sightlines. DOT acts after half of deaths hit at intersections. Brooklyn gets first fixes. Cyclists and walkers may see drivers before impact. Steel and stone replace painted lines.</p><p class=mb3>The Brooklyn Paper reported on June 11, 2025, that NYC DOT will redesign intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
