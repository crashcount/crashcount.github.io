In this area since 2022, cameras recorded <strong>17,170</strong> school‑zone speeding tickets after vehicles crossed the 16‑ticket threshold — violations that a speed limiter law aims to prevent. In 2025 to date, there are <strong>3,725</strong> such preventable tickets at that threshold. <a href=#>CrashCount analysis</a> of NYC camera data</p><p>Albany has a bill to stop them. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would require drivers with either 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year to install speed limiters. Ask your own electeds to co‑sponsor it. <a href=/take_action/>/take_action/</a></p><p>New York City can also lower speeds on local streets. Sammy’s Law lets the city set safer limits.
