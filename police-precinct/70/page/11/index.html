Twenty-seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand three hundred forty-five hurt. Three thousand three hundred sixty-one crashes since 2022. Each number is a body, a family, a life split open on the street.</p><p>The dead are old and young. A 73-year-old woman crushed by a turning SUV at Avenue L and East 12th. A 47-year-old cyclist thrown from his bike by a Kia SUV on Avenue O. A 58-year-old woman struck in the crosswalk by a dump truck that failed to yield. The list runs on. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> Five dead, eleven seriously hurt, four hundred eighty-eight more injured by these machines. Trucks and buses killed three, left three with grave wounds. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the count. The pattern is clear. The weight and speed of steel decide who walks home and who does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>The police in Precinct 70 have the tools. They can ticket speeders, stop reckless turns, target the corners where blood pools most often. But the numbers show the work is not done. The city has started to lower speed limits and redesign streets, but the pace is slow. <strong>Every day of delay means another family waits for a knock at the door.</strong></p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>A sister-in-law <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>spoke after a crash</a>: “It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.”</p><p>A <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>witness to another death</a> said, “I have no idea why he was doing donuts in the parking lot.”</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement, failure-to-yield crackdowns, and real protection for people who walk and bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to join the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
