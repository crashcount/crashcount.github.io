In this area since 2022, cameras recorded <strong>17,170</strong> school‑zone speeding tickets after vehicles crossed the 16‑ticket threshold — violations that a speed limiter law aims to prevent.

The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would require drivers with either 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year to install speed limiters.
