A truck turns. She does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, one person died and ten more suffered serious injuries on the streets of Precinct 70. Six hundred sixty-five were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>Children are not spared. Four kids suffered serious injuries in the past year. A school bus crashed through a fence at Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road, sending an eight-year-old boy and his mother to the hospital. A witness said, &ldquo;The bus was waiting because a pedestrian was in front of the school bus and all of a sudden we heard a boom. [The bus] jumped over the pavement and crashed.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>CBS New York</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and trucks do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed five, trucks and buses killed three. Cyclists and pedestrians are left broken at intersections. The city knows where the blood pools: nearly half of all deaths happen at corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Streetsblog NYC</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city has started to act. New barriers are coming to Ocean Avenue and other deadly corners. The plan is simple: keep cars back, let people live. But the pace is slow. Advocates want more, and they want it now. As one said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to see some simpler hardening at a quicker pace.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Streetsblog NYC</a></p><p>The police in Precinct 70 hold the power to enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They know the streets. They know the danger. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>Contact your council member, the precinct, and the DOT. Demand hard barriers at every deadly corner. Demand real enforcement.

Confusion contributed to the pedestrian’s injury.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan traveling west on Farragut Road was making a left turn when it struck a 45-year-old male pedestrian crossing with the signal but not at an intersection. The pedestrian suffered a fractured and dislocated shoulder, classified as injury severity 3. The driver, a male operating the vehicle alone, was unlicensed at the time of the crash. The point of impact was the center front end of the sedan, which sustained damage in the same area. The report lists the contributing factors as "Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion" and "Unspecified," but the critical driver error was operating the vehicle without a valid license while making a left turn. The pedestrian’s crossing with the signal is noted but not cited as a contributing factor to the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
