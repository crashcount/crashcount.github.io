Four people killed in the last year. Five left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Over 500 hurt. The dead are old and young. An 80-year-old man, Chaosheng Wu, was struck crossing Hylan Boulevard, a block from home. The driver stayed. Wu did not. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>A driver struck and killed an 80-year-old man who was walking across a busy Staten Island street a block from his home, police said Monday.</a></p><p>A 64-year-old woman, crossing Mason Avenue, crushed by a left-turning SUV. A 57-year-old woman, crossing in the crosswalk, killed by a truck. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and trucks do most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed four pedestrians here. Trucks killed one. Cars and trucks together caused most of the deaths and injuries. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement, families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h2><p>Local leaders talk about safety. They pass laws. They promise action. But the streets do not change fast enough. Speed cameras are coming to MTA bridges and tunnels. Governor Hochul’s office calls it &ldquo;one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/nyc-mta-bridges-tunnels-will-get-speed-cameras-hochul-says>said Hochul’s office</a>.</p><p>But on Hylan Boulevard, on Mason Avenue, on Capodanno, the danger remains. The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day leaders wait, another family risks losing someone. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
