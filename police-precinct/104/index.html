Eleven seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, 723 people have been injured in traffic crashes across Precinct 104. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. A cyclist, age 54, crushed by a truck on Juniper Boulevard North. A 47-year-old man, thrown from his bike and killed on Maurice Avenue. Two men on motorcycles, both 39, both dead—one on Eliot Avenue, one on Jackie Robinson Parkway. Each crash a name lost, a family broken.</p><p>Just this spring, a cyclist was killed by a truck at the corner of 80th Street and Juniper Boulevard North. The data reads: &ldquo;Crush Injuries. Apparent Death.&rdquo; The cause: &ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded.&rdquo; The driver survived. The cyclist did not. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars caused 331 pedestrian injuries and one death. Trucks and buses: 27 injuries, three deaths. Motorcycles and mopeds: 12 injuries, one death. Bikes: nine injuries, no deaths. The pattern is clear. The largest vehicles do the most harm. The smallest pay the price.</p><p>On the buses, riders are not safe either. Just last week, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb and slammed into a pole. Eight people were hurt. The driver, a new hire, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; Video showed more: he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb&mldr;I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>recalled one passenger</a>. The crash could have killed. It did not. This time.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can act—if they choose. The numbers show where the danger lies. The question is whether they will use that knowledge.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, safer street designs, and real accountability for repeat offenders. They can reward action and call out delay. But silence is complicity. Every day without change is another day of blood on the asphalt.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong> The dead cannot speak.
