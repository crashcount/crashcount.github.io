Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, 729 people have been hurt in 1,233 crashes across Precinct 104. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. A cyclist crushed by a turning truck on Juniper Boulevard North. A motorcyclist thrown and killed on the Jackie Robinson Parkway. A man on a bike, dead on Maurice Avenue, his body broken by a box truck. These are not numbers. These are lives ended, families gutted.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. On April 19, a 54-year-old cyclist was killed by a right-turning box truck. The driver disregarded traffic control, leaving the man with crush injuries, dead at the scene. On June 26, a 39-year-old motorcyclist was ejected and killed on the parkway. The record shows the same pattern: trucks, SUVs, motorcycles, bikes. The street is a gauntlet. <strong>SUVs and cars alone have killed at least one and injured 326 pedestrians here since 2022.</strong></p><h3 id=what-the-people-see>What the People See</h3><p>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said Ken Baur</a>, after a Q20 bus mounted the sidewalk and injured eight. Another rider, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>Samantha Hart, said</a>, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city has new powers. Sammy’s Law lets New York set its own speed limits. The DOT has started to lower speeds near schools and in slow zones. But the default speed on most streets remains deadly. The police in Precinct 104 have the tools: they can enforce speed limits, crack down on reckless driving, and target crash hotspots. They just need to use them. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Enforce the law. Protect the people who walk, bike, and wait for the bus. The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
