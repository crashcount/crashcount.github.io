Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area.

Prosecutors allege Pena drove at 83 mph—over three times the speed limit—while drunk and high, running a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street. His blood alcohol content was .156, far above the legal limit. The crash killed Justin Diaz, 23, who was driving to work. Pena had 25 prior school zone speeding tickets and was charged with manslaughter, assault, reckless driving, and more. Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.” The article highlights repeated dangerous driving and questions about how such drivers remain on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both injured parties were conscious and restrained.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a collision involving a sedan and two SUVs occurred on the Long Island Expressway at 12:33 AM. The sedan, traveling east, struck the center front end of an SUV, which sustained damage to its left front bumper. Another SUV was impacted at its left rear bumper. Two occupants in the sedan—a 40-year-old male driver and a 41-year-old female front passenger—were injured, suffering whiplash and upper arm injuries. Both were conscious and wearing lap belts and harnesses. The report explicitly cites "Unsafe Speed" as a contributing factor for both injured occupants, indicating driver error as a key cause. There is no mention of victim fault or contributing victim behavior. The crash highlights the dangers of excessive speed on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

It struck a parked car, which smashed into three men stepping out. One man died. Two others hurt. The driver had a medical episode. Metal, bodies, and chaos on Atlantic Avenue.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on March 29, 2025, that Zhihong Shi, 31, died after a van driver lost control and struck him and two others on 87th St. and Atlantic Ave. The article states, "Victim Zhihong Shi was exiting a double parked car with the two other victims...when the driver of a passing Ford Econoline van lost control of his wheel." The van, driven by a 35-year-old who suffered a medical episode, hit a parked car, which then crashed into the men. All three victims were hospitalized; only Shi could not be saved. No charges were filed as police investigated. The crash highlights risks from medical emergencies behind the wheel and the dangers of double parking in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
