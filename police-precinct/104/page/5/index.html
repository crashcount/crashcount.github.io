Twenty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, five more dead, eleven more lives changed forever. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, parents. A cyclist crushed on Maurice Avenue. A motorcyclist dead on Jackie Robinson Parkway. A pedestrian struck and left with nothing but a name on a report. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p><strong>On April 19, a cyclist was killed by a box truck at Juniper Boulevard North and 80th Street.</strong> The data says only this: “Crush Injuries.

Apparent Death.”</p><p>The pattern is clear. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has the power to act. Albany handed New York City the keys with Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The police can crack down on speeding, reckless turns, and failure to yield. But the streets remain the same. The dead keep coming.</p><p><strong>“It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,”</strong> said Jacqueline Cox after a recent crash in Queens (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>). The pain is not abstract. It is lived, every day, by survivors and families.</p><p><strong>“I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I’ll be more cautious of my surroundings,”</strong> said Samantha Hart, after a bus mounted the curb and smashed a pole (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>). The burden falls on those with the least power.</p><h3 id=the-precincts-role-action-or-excuse>The Precinct’s Role: Action or Excuse</h3><p>Precinct 104 can enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They can respond to dangerous conditions. They have the tools. They just need to use them.</p><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is relentless.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. Every silence from leadership is a choice.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The driver failed to yield while making a left turn on slippery pavement. The pedestrian was crossing without signal and went into shock.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred at 17:49 on 62 Street near 53 Drive in Queens. A 43-year-old female pedestrian was crossing a marked crosswalk without a signal when she was hit by a northwestern-bound 2017 Honda sedan making a left turn. The point of impact was the sedan's center front end. The pedestrian sustained injuries to her hip and upper leg and was reported to be in shock. The report cites the driver's failure to yield right-of-way as a contributing factor, compounded by slippery pavement conditions. The sedan showed no visible damage. The pedestrian's crossing without signal is noted but not listed as a contributing factor. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. This incident underscores the dangers posed by driver errors and road conditions at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
