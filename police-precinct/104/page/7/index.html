On February 26, Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and crashed into Justin Diaz’s BMW. Diaz, 23, died after being rushed to the hospital. Prosecutors say Pena’s blood-alcohol content was 0.156% and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. Surveillance footage shows Diaz had the right-of-way. The article states, “The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.” Two passengers in Pena’s car were also injured. The case highlights the lethal consequences of high-speed, impaired driving and raises questions about enforcement and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 43-year-old female pedestrian was crossing a marked crosswalk without a signal when she was hit by a northwestern-bound 2017 Honda sedan making a left turn. The point of impact was the sedan's center front end. The pedestrian sustained injuries to her hip and upper leg and was reported to be in shock. The report cites the driver's failure to yield right-of-way as a contributing factor, compounded by slippery pavement conditions. The sedan showed no visible damage. The pedestrian's crossing without signal is noted but not listed as a contributing factor. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. This incident underscores the dangers posed by driver errors and road conditions at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
