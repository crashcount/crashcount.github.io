He died where he fell. Police said, &ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old woman, Breanna Henderson, struck crossing Myrtle Avenue at Woodhaven Boulevard. She never made it home. &ldquo;A 23-year-old woman died after a motorcycle rider ran over her as she was crossing the street in Queens early Friday morning, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> in crashes in Precinct 104. <strong>Ten more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers do not stop. In that same year, there were <strong>707 injuries</strong> and <strong>1,207 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Motor Vehicle Collisions</a>). Each number is a name, a family, a life split open on the street.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight?</h3><p><strong>Trucks, SUVs, motorcycles, bikes.</strong> The dead and injured are not just numbers. They are children, workers, elders. The city counts them, but the counting does not stop the bleeding. The police have the tools: tickets for speeding, for failing to yield, for reckless turns. They know the hotspots. They know the hours. They know the names.</p><p>But the silence is heavy. No new laws from local leaders. No bold action from the precinct. The city talks of Vision Zero, but the bodies keep coming. The police can act. They can enforce the law. They can slow the cars. They can protect the crossings. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice, a failure to act. The police can crack down on speeding and reckless driving. The city can redesign streets and lower speed limits. The leaders can speak, or they can stay silent. The blood on the street will tell the story either way.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. Do not let silence win.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Surveillance footage showed Pena’s Mercedes striking Diaz’s BMW at high speed, sending it skidding down the street. Diaz, 23, died. Pena admitted at the scene, 'I hit him. I ran the red light. And I'm a firefighter.' The FDNY cited conduct rules in his dismissal. The article highlights Pena’s failure to render aid and notes his attempt to invoke his firefighter status. The case raises questions about accountability for city employees and the dangers of impaired, reckless driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly twice the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article notes, 'Police charged Pena with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing to take a breath test.' Surveillance footage confirmed Pena had been drinking for hours before the crash. The incident highlights the lethal consequences of impaired, reckless driving and raises questions about screening and accountability for city employees operating vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
