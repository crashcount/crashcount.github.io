He died where he fell. Police said, &ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old woman, Breanna Henderson, struck crossing Myrtle Avenue at Woodhaven Boulevard. She never made it home. &ldquo;A 23-year-old woman died after a motorcycle rider ran over her as she was crossing the street in Queens early Friday morning, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/woman-23-dies-struck-yamaha-motorcycle-rider-queens/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> in crashes in Precinct 104. <strong>Ten more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers do not stop. In that same year, there were <strong>707 injuries</strong> and <strong>1,207 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Motor Vehicle Collisions</a>). Each number is a name, a family, a life split open on the street.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight?</h3><p><strong>Trucks, SUVs, motorcycles, bikes.</strong> The dead and injured are not just numbers. They are children, workers, elders. The city counts them, but the counting does not stop the bleeding. The police have the tools: tickets for speeding, for failing to yield, for reckless turns. They know the hotspots. They know the hours. They know the names.</p><p>But the silence is heavy. No new laws from local leaders. No bold action from the precinct. The city talks of Vision Zero, but the bodies keep coming. The police can act. They can enforce the law. They can slow the cars. They can protect the crossings. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice, a failure to act. The police can crack down on speeding and reckless driving. The city can redesign streets and lower speed limits. The leaders can speak, or they can stay silent. The blood on the street will tell the story either way.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. Do not let silence win.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The narrative states, 'A bus hit a stopped bike. The rider, 54, flew off. No helmet. Blood ran. He was awake, hurting everywhere. The bus kept going. The bike stayed down.' The cyclist suffered injuries to his entire body and was ejected from the bike, sustaining severe bleeding but remaining conscious. The report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but the primary sequence of events centers on the bus striking a stationary cyclist. The bus driver continued without stopping. No driver-specific errors are cited in the data, but the impact and aftermath underscore the systemic dangers facing cyclists on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Two station wagons/SUVs collided, one traveling west and the other south. The driver of the Pennsylvania-registered SUV, a licensed 40-year-old woman, was going straight ahead and impacted the right front bumper. The New York-registered SUV, driven by an unlicensed 40-year-old man, also traveling straight ahead, suffered center front end damage from the collision. Both drivers sustained head injuries and whiplash, with injury severity rated as moderate (3). The front passenger in the Pennsylvania SUV, a 40-year-old woman, was also injured with head trauma and whiplash. The police report cites failure to yield right-of-way as the contributing factor. Both drivers were conscious and restrained by lap belts and harnesses. The unlicensed status of one driver adds to the systemic danger present in this crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
