The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring the moped driver's dangerous actions. The rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the report, but these details follow the primary driver errors. The sedan driver, licensed and traveling south, was also involved.

The impact ejected the rider, causing serious injuries: fractures, dislocations, and distortions to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The bicyclist was not using safety equipment at the time, but no other factors were cited. This crash shows how a moment of driver distraction can inflict lasting harm on people outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
