Fourteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the streets of Precinct 103—<a href=/neighborhood/QN1201/>Jamaica</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/QN1202/>South Jamaica</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/QN1206/>Hollis</a>—have seen 3,989 crashes. <strong>More than 2,290 people hurt.</strong></p><p>A 56-year-old man tried to cross Hillside Avenue. He did not make it. A moped rider, just 18, was thrown from his seat and died on 89th Avenue. A 63-year-old Uber driver lost control on 90th Avenue. The garage collapsed. His family waits for him still. &ldquo;He was a caregiver. That&rsquo;s very, very tough for us,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/01/22/uber-driver-died-queens-crash-worked-nights-spend-days-kids/>said his cousin</a>.</p><p><strong>The dead do not get a second chance.</strong></p><h2 id=the-role-of-the-precinct>The Role of the Precinct</h2><p><strong>Precinct 103 has the power to act.</strong> Police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They can make it known: reckless driving will not be ignored.</p><p>But the numbers do not lie. In the last year alone, injuries rose by 24%. Deaths tripled. The crisis is not slowing. It is gathering speed.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>City Hall and Albany have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half. But the law that keeps those cameras running is again at risk of expiring. Each delay is another family broken.</p><p>Local leaders have spoken of Vision Zero. They have promised safety. But promises do not stop cars. Only action does.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand real enforcement. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
