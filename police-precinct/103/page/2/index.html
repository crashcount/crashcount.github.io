Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,400 hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. Some never made it home. Some never stood a chance.</p><p>Last year, a 56-year-old man was killed by an SUV on Hillside Avenue. He was crossing, not at an intersection. The driver kept going straight. The man was left with a concussion, unconscious, and died soon after. No warning. No time to react. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>In April, a 19-year-old on a motorcycle was struck and killed by an SUV at 90th Avenue and 188th Street. He was ejected, his body crushed. Helmet or not, the outcome was the same. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=buses-bikes-and-the-unforgiving-road>Buses, Bikes, and the Unforgiving Road</h3><p>The violence is not just cars. Buses, mopeds, bikes—they all play a part. In August, an 18-year-old on a moped was killed when he collided with a bus on 89th Avenue and 168th Street. He was ejected, died from severe bleeding. The bus kept going straight. The moped did not.</p><p>Last week, a Q20 bus in Queens jumped the curb, smashed a pole, and injured eight people. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; But after reviewing the video, officials now believe he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a></p><p>A passenger on the bus said, &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the tools.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. The precinct can enforce them. The police can crack down on reckless drivers, target hotspots, and issue tickets for speeding and failure to yield. But the carnage continues. <strong>Every delay is another body in the street.</strong></p><p>The numbers show who pays the price. <strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—one death, five serious injuries, and nearly 500 crashes.</strong> Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds left a trail of ejections and broken bodies. Bikes were not spared, but their toll was smaller.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement.

Rollins allegedly ran over Gary Charlotin, who was crossing Hempstead Ave., then stopped for two minutes before fleeing. According to Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, Rollins 'proceeded to speed away from the scene while dragging the victim's body, while the victim was still alive.' Bystanders pleaded for the driver to stop. The incident highlights the lethal consequences of driver inattention and failure to yield, as well as the dangers posed by drivers who flee crash scenes.
