Seventeen seriously hurt.</strong> More than 2,400 injured since 2022. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The pain does not fade. It lingers on the corners and crosswalks of <a href=/neighborhood/qn1201/>Jamaica</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/qn1202/>South Jamaica</a>, and <a href=/neighborhood/qn1206/>Hollis</a>.</p><p>Just months ago, a 19-year-old on a moped was killed at 90th Avenue and 188th Street. A 63-year-old man died behind the wheel at 143rd Street and 90th Avenue. A 56-year-old pedestrian was struck and killed by an SUV on Hillside Avenue. An 18-year-old died, ejected from his scooter, after colliding with a bus on 168th Street. The list is long. The grief is longer.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> They killed at least one person and injured nearly 500 pedestrians in this precinct alone. Trucks and buses injured dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies in the street—one dead, several ejected, many broken. Bikes caused injuries too, but the scale is not the same. The street is a gauntlet, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>The city has the tools. <strong>Speed cameras now run 24/7.</strong> The law allows lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. The dead do not wait for policy. The police can do more. They can enforce the law, crack down on speeding, failure to yield, reckless driving. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They just need to act.</p><p>After a recent bus crash in Queens, a passenger <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said, &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus.&rdquo;</a> Another <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>added, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo;</a> The fear is real. The danger is real. The response is not enough.</p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is failure.</strong> Demand more from your leaders. Call the precinct. Call your council member. Demand speed enforcement, safer crossings, and real protection for those outside the car. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
