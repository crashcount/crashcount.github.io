These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the man struck crossing Hillside Avenue, the teenager thrown from a moped, the woman crushed by a turning truck. The street remembers every one.</p><p>Just this spring, a 19-year-old on a moped was killed at 90th Avenue and 188th Street. He was ejected, crushed, and died at the scene. In January, a 63-year-old man died behind the wheel on 143rd Street. Last year, a pedestrian was killed by an SUV on Hillside Avenue. The list goes on. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed, maimed, and scarred. Out of all pedestrian injuries, sedans and SUVs were responsible for the largest share—<strong>at least 491 incidents, including one death and five serious injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses followed, with 43 injuries and two serious cases. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own trail: nine injuries, one serious, no deaths. The street is a battlefield, and the machines are winning.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has tools. The police have power. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target the corners where blood is spilled most often. But the carnage continues. <strong>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb&mldr;I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said a passenger after a crash in Flushing</a>. The MTA pulled the driver from service. The investigation drags on. <strong>&ldquo;The accident remains under investigation,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said authorities</a>. The street waits for answers.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to act. They can demand more enforcement, safer street design, and real accountability. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, and action against repeat offenders. Or they can do nothing, and the toll will rise.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Demand that Precinct 103 stops being a graveyard. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
