A car turns. The man does not make it home. In Precinct 9, this story repeats. <strong>Seven people killed.

But the work is not done until the killing stops.</p><p>Last year, a driver made a U-turn at East 4th and Avenue D. He aimed his car at a man and hit him. The victim survived. The driver fled. Police are still looking. Police are looking for the driver of a vehicle who intentionally struck a pedestrian with their vehicle on the Lower East Side on Monday night, as <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/driver-strikes-lower-east-side-pedestrian-06022025/>reported by The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-silence>Leadership: Action or Silence</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law.

The clock runs out. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The police can enforce. The Council can legislate.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers.

Mayor Eric Adams said, 'Fifth Avenue is a bustling boulevard... with more people walking down the street every hour than fill Madison Square Garden during a sold-out Knicks game.' The plan nearly doubles sidewalk widths and expands pedestrian zones, cutting space for vehicles. The redesign adds tree buffers, benches, and stormwater upgrades. Pedestrians make up 70% of avenue traffic but have less than half the space.

The coalition pushes for the SAFE Streets Package, including speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders and the 'Idaho stop' for cyclists. The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.'

Riders and pedestrians caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 13, 2025, that NYPD has begun issuing criminal summonses, not just traffic tickets, to cyclists and e-bike riders for violations like running red lights or riding on sidewalks. The change means accused riders must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. The move follows the death of Priscilla Loke, struck by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters. The article notes, 'Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court.' The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The cyclist struck it. He fell. A truck crushed him. Medics rushed him to Bellevue. He died. The street stayed busy. The drivers waited. The city moved on.</p><p class=mb3>According to NY Daily News (May 3, 2025), Georgios Smaragdis, 44, was killed while riding his e-bike west on Broome Street in Soho. The article states, "he slammed into the door of a Mercedes van that its driver had just flung open," sending him into the path of a red delivery truck that ran him over. Both drivers remained at the scene. The van driver told the outlet, "I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy." Police have not announced charges. The crash highlights the persistent danger of dooring and the lethal consequences for cyclists when drivers fail to check for oncoming traffic before opening doors. The incident underscores ongoing risks for vulnerable road users in Manhattan’s dense traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
