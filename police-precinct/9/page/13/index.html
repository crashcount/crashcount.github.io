A car turns. The man does not make it home. In Precinct 9, this story repeats. <strong>Seven people killed. Twelve left with serious, life-altering injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 657 more have been hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>A 79-year-old woman, crossing Bowery at East 4th, struck by a taxi. She died at the intersection. A 45-year-old man, hit by a bus on East 10th and Avenue D. Gone. A 19-year-old, crushed by a boom lift on East 7th. The street does not forgive. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> makes it plain.</p><h3 id=the-police-power-and-responsibility>The Police: Power and Responsibility</h3><p><strong>Precinct 9 holds the line. Or it can.</strong> The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the work is not done until the killing stops.</p><p>Last year, a driver made a U-turn at East 4th and Avenue D. He aimed his car at a man and hit him. The victim survived. The driver fled. Police are still looking. Police are looking for the driver of a vehicle who intentionally struck a pedestrian with their vehicle on the Lower East Side on Monday night, as <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/driver-strikes-lower-east-side-pedestrian-06022025/>reported by The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-silence>Leadership: Action or Silence</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. The Mayor can act. But every day they wait, the street claims another body. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark. The law to keep them alive sits in Albany. The clock runs out. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The police can enforce. The Council can legislate. The Mayor can lead. But only if you make them. Call. Write.
