One bicyclist, a 34-year-old woman, suffered a shoulder fracture and dislocation. According to the police report, contributing factors were “Passing or Lane Usage Improper” and “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” The report lists one cyclist as unlicensed, reflecting bike license status fields, and both bikes showed center front-end impact. These driver errors—improper lane usage and distraction—are the stated causes in the data. No other injuries were recorded. Helmet use is noted as “None” for the injured rider and appears only after the driver errors here because it is not listed as a contributing factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Change moves slow.</p><p class=mb3>New York Magazine - Curbed (2025-07-29) reports city officials and business groups will fund a $3 million, two-year study to redesign 14th Street. The plan aims for a 'complete street'—space for pedestrians, cyclists, transit, and limited cars. The article notes, 'Their (mostly) shared goal is to make 14th into what's often called a complete street.' The study will assess traffic flow and street dynamics. The busway, which restricts cars, may become permanent. No crash or injury data is cited, but the focus is on systemic street changes, not individual driver actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
