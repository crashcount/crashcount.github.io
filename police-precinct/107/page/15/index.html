The primary contributing factor was an unsafe lane change by a sedan, which caused a collision impacting the motorcycle's front center. The motorcycle driver, a 45-year-old male, was partially ejected and sustained injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, with minor bleeding and shock reported. The sedan involved struck the motorcycle with its left rear bumper. Both drivers were licensed in New York.
