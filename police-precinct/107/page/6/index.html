Eight seriously hurt. In the last year, the streets of Precinct 107 have not been quiet. A cyclist, age 20, killed on 164th Street. A 21-year-old ejected from a moped, dead on 73rd Avenue. A 73-year-old driver, gone after a crash on the Long Island Expressway. These are not numbers. These are lives cut short, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>In twelve months: 1,212 crashes. 803 injured. Eight left with injuries that change everything. Under 18, 66 hurt. The young are not spared. The old are not spared. No one is spared.

Sedans and SUVs caused the bulk of pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses killed and hurt too. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but their toll is small. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable—walkers, cyclists, children—are on the front line.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law allows the city to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Precinct 107, the carnage goes on. The police have the tools: they can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, target crash hotspots. They can act. They must act.</p><p>Local leaders have the power. They can push for more enforcement, safer street designs, and lower speed limits. They can demand action, not words. But every day without change is another day of risk. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>This is not fate. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits, more enforcement, safer crossings. Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
