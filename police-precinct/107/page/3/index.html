Police logged a serious injury from that crash (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>They are part of a larger toll here. Since Jan 1, 2022, in Precinct 107, <strong>16 people have been killed</strong> and <strong>3,412 injured</strong> in <strong>5,636 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Four people walking and one person on a bike are among the dead (mode split, precinct data).</p><p><strong>This Week</strong></p><ul><li>Sep 1: at 73 Ave and 197 St, a driver in a sedan hit a 14‑year‑old riding a bike; police recorded failure to yield and a traffic control disregard in the crash report (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 18: at Union Tpke and 134 St, a driver turning right injured a 42‑year‑old on a bike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 12: at Union Tpke and 189 St, a driver going straight caused a crush injury to a 61‑year‑old man crossing outside a marked crosswalk (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=the-pattern-doesnt-blink>The pattern doesn’t blink</h3><p>Injuries here pile up at school and commute hours: around 8 AM (220 injuries) and mid‑afternoon into the evening, with 2 PM (237), 3 PM (221), and 5 PM (220) all near the top (hourly distribution, precinct data). Police also record driver inattention/distraction in crashes that injured 21 people, and failure to yield in crashes that injured 12 (contributing factors, precinct data).</p><p>On Dec 9, 2022, along 73 Avenue, an 82‑year‑old man walking was killed by a driver going straight. Police listed the crash location off a crosswalk (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Ten months earlier, on Feb 24, 2022, at Union Turnpike and 193 Street, a truck driver turned right and killed an 83‑year‑old woman in the crosswalk (precinct crash record, same dataset).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bites>Where the street bites</h3><p>The worst injury clusters in this precinct sit on and around the big roads: Grand Central Parkway and the Long Island Expressway lead the list, with the Van Wyck Expressway and Clearview also high. Even local streets bleed: 73 Avenue ranks among the precinct’s top pain points (top intersections, precinct data; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>These corners are not mysteries. They are habits. Drivers keep turning through people and glancing at screens while the light changes and the day goes on (contributing factors, hourly distribution, precinct data).</p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-slow-the-miles>Fix the turns. Slow the miles.</h3><p>Start at the known killers. Daylight the corners and harden the turns on 73 Avenue and along Union Turnpike where people cross. Use leading pedestrian intervals and raised crossings where the data shows repeat harm. Target failure‑to‑yield enforcement at those nodes in the morning and mid‑afternoon, when injuries peak (top intersections, contributing factors, hourly distribution; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, the tools exist. Lower speeds save lives, and the city can set lower limits on local streets. “When regular people band together and demand safer streets, speed limits get lowered, laws get passed, streets get redesigned, and lives are saved,” says Families for Safe Streets (<a href=https://ny.familiesforsafestreets.org/about>Families for Safe Streets</a>).</p><p>Repeat speeders do outsized harm. Intelligent speed assistance for habitual offenders would keep the worst drivers from blowing past limits again and again. The on‑the‑books ask is simple: pass the bill that requires speed limiters for repeat camera and points violators (policy described on our site’s <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page).</p><h3 id=whos-accountable-here>Who’s accountable here?</h3><p>This is Council District <a href=/council-district/24/>District 24</a>, Assembly District <a href=/assembly-district/24/>AD 24</a>, and Senate District <a href=/senate-district/11/>SD 11</a>. The record here does not show whether Council Member James F. Gennaro, Assembly Member David Weprin, or State Senator Toby Stavisky have sponsored a bill to require speed limiters for repeat speeders. The deaths and injuries are documented. The sponsorships are not. What gives?</p><p>The man hit at 70 Ave and 147 St was crossing his street at 9 AM. Start there. Slow the turns at that corner. Then keep going.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to slow our streets and rein in repeat speeders.

Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the corridor suffers from 'an inconsistent, patchwork design' and blocked lanes. Buses crawl at four miles per hour due to congestion. Only a third of road space serves buses, though 83% of transit users ride them. The project adds camera-enforced bus lanes, parking, and loading zones.
