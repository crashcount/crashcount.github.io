Dead. A teenage girl, 18, killed in a sedan crash on Atlantic Avenue. Dead. An elderly man, 73, behind the wheel on the BQE, never made it home. Dead. Four lives ended on the streets of Precinct 76 since 2022. <strong>Two were pedestrians. Two were drivers or passengers.</strong></p><p>In the last twelve months alone, <strong>252 people were hurt in crashes here</strong>. Four suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. <strong>Two did not survive</strong>. The numbers do not stop. They do not care about age. Children, teens, the old—all are counted. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> In this precinct, they caused the only recorded deaths. They left dozens with broken bones, torn flesh, and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Even bikes, meant for freedom, left one with injuries. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks or rides.</p><h3 id=the-precincts-role>The Precinct’s Role</h3><p><strong>Precinct 76 holds the power to act.</strong> Police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They can make it clear: reckless driving is not welcome here. But action is not automatic. It comes only when the public demands it.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, more cameras, lower speed limits. But promises do not stop a truck from turning into a crosswalk. <strong>The law now allows the city to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> The cameras can run all night. But unless leaders act, unless police enforce, the numbers will keep rising.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand that every crash is treated as a crime, not an accident. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Plaintiffs argue the city violated Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires advance notice and community input before removing bike lanes. The Department of Transportation skipped this step, announcing the removal on social media after consulting only select community members. The article quotes the lawsuit: the city acted "improperly, irrationally, without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion." Data cited in the suit show the upgraded lane improved safety for all road users. Councilman Lincoln Restler supported the legal action, seeking a restraining order to keep the lane. The case highlights failures in city process and the risks posed when safe infrastructure is abruptly erased.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles.

The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
