Dead. A teenage girl, 18, killed in a sedan crash on Atlantic Avenue. Dead. An elderly man, 73, behind the wheel on the BQE, never made it home. Dead. Four lives ended on the streets of Precinct 76 since 2022. <strong>Two were pedestrians. Two were drivers or passengers.</strong></p><p>In the last twelve months alone, <strong>252 people were hurt in crashes here</strong>. Four suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. <strong>Two did not survive</strong>. The numbers do not stop. They do not care about age. Children, teens, the old—all are counted. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> In this precinct, they caused the only recorded deaths. They left dozens with broken bones, torn flesh, and worse. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Even bikes, meant for freedom, left one with injuries. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks or rides.</p><h3 id=the-precincts-role>The Precinct’s Role</h3><p><strong>Precinct 76 holds the power to act.</strong> Police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They can make it clear: reckless driving is not welcome here. But action is not automatic. It comes only when the public demands it.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p>City leaders talk about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets, more cameras, lower speed limits. But promises do not stop a truck from turning into a crosswalk. <strong>The law now allows the city to lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> The cameras can run all night. But unless leaders act, unless police enforce, the numbers will keep rising.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand that every crash is treated as a crime, not an accident. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
