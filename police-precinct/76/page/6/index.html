The incident occurred at 9:49 a.m. The narrative states, 'A 65-year-old man lay still in the road. A southbound box truck passed. No screech, no crash, no damage. Just the crack of bone. The shoulder gave. Then silence.' The police report lists the pedestrian's location as 'not at intersection' and his action as 'other actions in roadway.' Both contributing factors for the pedestrian are marked as 'Unspecified.' The box truck, registered in Illinois and operated by a licensed driver from Pennsylvania, was reportedly 'avoiding object in roadway' before the crash. Despite the lack of visible vehicle damage, the impact proved fatal. The report does not cite any specific driver errors or victim behaviors as contributing factors, but the outcome underscores the lethal risk faced by pedestrians outside intersections in the presence of large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash leaves the eastbound lanes scarred, the morning unbroken, the system unchanged.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, two station wagons/SUVs collided eastbound on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. The crash occurred after a 'sudden swerve,' with one vehicle changing lanes and the other going straight ahead. The report lists 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors, both indicating driver error. The 21-year-old male driver of a 2007 Toyota SUV suffered severe facial bleeding but remained conscious and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The point of impact was the center front end of the Toyota and the right rear bumper of the 2019 Ford SUV. No pedestrians or cyclists were involved.
