Four people are dead since 2022. Twelve more carry wounds that will not heal. <strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—no one is spared.</strong> In the last year alone, 259 people were injured in 548 crashes. Five were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</p><p>A woman, 83, was killed by a turning truck on Bond Street. The record shows only this: &ldquo;Apparent Death.&rdquo; No warning, no time to run. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, an 18-year-old died in the front seat. The cause: &ldquo;Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; The car did not stop. The numbers do not lie. The dead do not speak.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-the-precinct>The Role of the Precinct</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools. They can enforce the law.</strong> They can ticket speeders, stop reckless drivers, and target the corners where people die. But the violence continues. The records fill with names and numbers. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Local leaders have the power to change the story. They can push for lower speed limits, redesign deadly intersections, and demand real enforcement. But too often, the burden falls on the broken. Laws that target cyclists and pedestrians do not stop the killing. The driver walks away. The family buries their own.</p><p>A relative, after one crash, said only this: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo;</a></p><p>After another, the driver told police: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>The cost is always paid by the most vulnerable.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone, and a choice not made by those in power. The police can crack down. The council can lower the speed limit. The mayor can demand more. But only if you force them.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
