A black SUV speeds east, hits him, and keeps going. The man, in his fifties, is fighting for his life at Jamaica Hospital. The driver does not stop. The street is quiet again, but the damage is done. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>Police say the victim was struck by a black SUV traveling eastbound on 101st Avenue that kept going.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, four people died and 706 were injured on the streets of Precinct 102. Four were left with injuries so severe they may never recover. These are not numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors—people who did not make it home.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-suvs-sedans-and-the-unstoppable-machine>The Pattern: SUVs, Sedans, and the Unstoppable Machine</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In three years, they killed six, left three with life-changing injuries, and hurt dozens more. Trucks killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one and injured others. Bikes caused one moderate injury. The streets are a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-delays-and-the-role-of-police>Leadership: Promises, Delays, and the Role of Police</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run 24/7. Red-light cameras are multiplying. The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but leaders have not pulled the trigger. The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can act now. They just need to know it matters.</p><p>After a deadly hate-fueled attack on the Van Wyck, the District Attorney <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/18/queens-driver-gets-10-years-in-deadly-road-rage-hate-crime-attack/>declared, &ldquo;We will not tolerate hate in Queens, the most diverse place in the world.&rdquo;</a> Words are not enough. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the 102nd Precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. Demand safe streets for the people who walk and ride.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
