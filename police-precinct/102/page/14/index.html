Records <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>show</a> a vehicle going straight. He never got up.</p><p>In April, a 23-year-old woman was struck and killed at Woodhaven Boulevard. A motorcycle, going north. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Speed</a> was a factor, the data says.</p><p>In March on Atlantic Avenue at 87th Street, two men <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>were hit and killed</a> off the crosswalk. The driver was injured. Two parked cars were struck.</p><p>Last year on 101st Avenue at 120th Street, a pickup turned left and killed a 47-year-old man who had the signal. The listed cause <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>was driver distraction</a>.</p><p>The Grind of Numbers</p><p>Since 2022, this precinct has logged 4,003 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes</a>. Sixteen people <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>were killed</a>. Two thousand three hundred sixty <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>were injured</a>. Twenty-three <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>were seriously hurt</a>.</p><p>This year isn’t easing. Year to date, crashes <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>rose</a> to 850 from 668, up 27%. Deaths <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>rose</a> to 4 from 3. Injuries <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>climbed</a> to 530 from 401.

In Queens South, “<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>17 people died in traffic crashes this year through Aug. 10</a>,” reporters wrote, citing NYPD data.</p><p>Hit-and-run is its own quiet plague. In a nearby case by JFK, police said: “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.</a>”</p><p>What 102 Can Do Now</p><p>The tools are simple. Enforce the speed limit on 101st Avenue, Atlantic Avenue, and Woodhaven Boulevard. Write failure-to-yield summonses at left-turn hot spots. Flood known danger blocks at peak hours. Treat hit-and-run like the violent crime it is. The data points to the corners. The work is on the street.</p><p>Hold Power to Account</p><p>Leaders in council, assembly, and senate can act. But every hour is a gamble on our lives. Make them feel it.</p><p>Call to Action</p><p>Speak up, then keep speaking. Demand slower speeds, hard enforcement, and real fixes on the deadly corridors named above. Start here and do not stop: <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
