Sixteen people have died on these streets since 2022. More than 2,300 have been injured. Nineteen suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. Children, elders, workers—all caught in the path.</p><p>Just this spring, a 47-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at 101st Avenue and 120th Street. The truck driver was making a left turn. The cause: &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to police</a>. He never made it home.</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, two men—one 31, one 67—were killed in the street. No warning. No chance. The crash report lists &ldquo;Unspecified&rdquo; for the cause. The street is the same. The outcome is final.</p><h3 id=the-usual-weapons>The Usual Weapons</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. They killed seven. They left 265 with minor injuries, 61 with moderate, five with injuries called serious. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles and mopeds, one dead, a handful hurt. Bikes, six injured, none killed. The machines are heavy. The bodies are not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-silence>Leadership: Action or Silence?</h3><p>The police in Precinct 102 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the numbers keep climbing. Crashes are up 25% this year. Injuries are up 36%. Serious injuries have quadrupled.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to act. They can demand lower speed limits. They can push for street redesigns. They can call for more enforcement. But every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>&ldquo;This was a landmark case where both an unlicensed teenage driver and his parents were held responsible for the teenager&rsquo;s deadly actions,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz</a>.
