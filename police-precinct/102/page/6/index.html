Records <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>show</a> a vehicle going straight. He never got up.</p><p>In April, a 23-year-old woman was struck and killed at Woodhaven Boulevard. A motorcycle, going north. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Speed</a> was a factor, the data says.</p><p>In March on Atlantic Avenue at 87th Street, two men <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>were hit and killed</a> off the crosswalk. The driver was injured. Two parked cars were struck.</p><p>Last year on 101st Avenue at 120th Street, a pickup turned left and killed a 47-year-old man who had the signal. The listed cause <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>was driver distraction</a>.</p><p>The Grind of Numbers</p><p>Since 2022, this precinct has logged 4,003 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes</a>. Sixteen people <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>were killed</a>. Two thousand three hundred sixty <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>were injured</a>. Twenty-three <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>were seriously hurt</a>.</p><p>This year isn’t easing. Year to date, crashes <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>rose</a> to 850 from 668, up 27%. Deaths <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>rose</a> to 4 from 3. Injuries <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>climbed</a> to 530 from 401.

In Queens South, “<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>17 people died in traffic crashes this year through Aug. 10</a>,” reporters wrote, citing NYPD data.</p><p>Hit-and-run is its own quiet plague. In a nearby case by JFK, police said: “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.</a>”</p><p>What 102 Can Do Now</p><p>The tools are simple. Enforce the speed limit on 101st Avenue, Atlantic Avenue, and Woodhaven Boulevard. Write failure-to-yield summonses at left-turn hot spots. Flood known danger blocks at peak hours. Treat hit-and-run like the violent crime it is. The data points to the corners. The work is on the street.</p><p>Hold Power to Account</p><p>Leaders in council, assembly, and senate can act. But every hour is a gamble on our lives. Make them feel it.</p><p>Call to Action</p><p>Speak up, then keep speaking. Demand slower speeds, hard enforcement, and real fixes on the deadly corridors named above. Start here and do not stop: <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Both the sedan driver and the bus passenger were injured, with the driver sustaining head injuries and the passenger suffering knee, lower leg, and foot injuries. Both occupants were wearing lap belts and were not ejected. The report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor for both drivers. No victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors. The collision highlights the systemic danger posed by driver distraction during critical maneuvers like left turns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
