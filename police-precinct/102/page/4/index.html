Seventeen left with serious injuries. Over two thousand hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. They are the price of inaction.</p><p>A van lost control on Atlantic Avenue. Three men were struck as they stepped from a car. <strong>Zhihong Shi, 31, died at Jamaica Hospital.</strong> The others, ages 67 and 48, survived. The van driver had a medical episode. No charges filed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>Victim Zhihong Shi was exiting a double parked car with the two other victims&mldr; when the driver of a passing Ford Econoline van lost control of his wheel.</a></p><p>On Woodhaven Boulevard, a BMW driver chased down a motorcyclist after a minor crash. He ran him over. The bike caught fire. The rider died. <strong>District Attorney Melinda Katz said:</strong> <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>&ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed most.</strong> In the last year, four people died. Four more were left with life-changing injuries. Children, elders, workers. Cars and trucks did most of the killing—six deaths and three serious injuries from sedans and SUVs. Motorcycles and mopeds took one life. Trucks and buses took two more. The streets are not safe for the ones who walk or ride.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-role-of-police>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Role of Police</h2><p>The city has the tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half. But every day of delay is another day of risk. The police in Precinct 102 can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target crash hotspots. They can act—if they are told to act.</p><h2 id=what-now-the-call-that-matters>What Now? The Call That Matters</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where a walk to the store does not end in blood. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact was so forceful that a parked Ford SUV was also slammed. The police report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor, indicating the driver looked away before the crash. The sedan’s right front bumper bore the brunt of the collision. The woman was conscious at the scene, her injury classified as severe. No contributing factors related to the pedestrian’s behavior are cited in the report.
