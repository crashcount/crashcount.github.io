Same ending.</p><p>Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen on the Bronx River Parkway near E. 223rd St. He hit the car, then struck two riders. Both were thrown. Both died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, and he was released without bail, as the case continued. The victims were identified as 19‑year‑old Manuel Amarantepenalo and 21‑year‑old Enrique Martinez, both from the Bronx (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/11/bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>“Police have arrested and charged a man with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated,” reported one outlet (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>). “Two people were killed.

Nights are worst. Death spikes at 9 p.m. and past midnight. Three people died in the 9 p.m. hour. Two more at midnight. Another at 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. The bodies keep coming at 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The toll since 2022: 12 dead, 1,635 hurt. Pedestrians hit 330 times. Cyclists 137. Riders on small motors 65.

EAST 163 STREET leads the list with 62 injuries and four serious injuries. WEBSTER AVENUE follows with 51 injuries and three serious injuries. SOUTHERN BOULEVARD has a death. PARK AVENUE has two.

Cameras cut speeding where they go up. They work when leaders let them work (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>The city also has the power to lower speeds. Advocates are pressing for a default 20 mph limit on local streets and intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders. These measures save lives when used, and the ask is simple: use them (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><p>EAST 163 STREET. WEBSTER AVENUE. SOUTHERN BOULEVARD. Start with daylighting and hardened turns. Add head‑start signals for people on foot and bikes. Keep cameras hot after dark. Do it now, before the next name is logged (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Act</p><p>Two young men died on the parkway. Others died at the corner. The list will grow unless we force it to stop. Tell City Hall to slow the streets and rein in repeat speeders.
