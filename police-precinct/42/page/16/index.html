Thirty seriously hurt. Over 1,500 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each one is a body on the street, a family left waiting for someone who will not come home. In the last year alone, five people died and thirteen suffered life-changing wounds. The violence does not slow. It does not wait for policy.</p><p><strong>Just last month</strong>, a driver in Morrisania struck and killed a car wash worker. Police say the driver veered her 2011 Ford Escape directly into the path of another car, pinning Felix Thomas Bontia and leaving him to die. She ran. It took two years to make an arrest. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/us-news/reckless-driver-who-allegedly-struck-killed-nyc-car-wash-worker-is-busted-2-years-later-cops/>She was charged with manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident, police said.</a></p><p><strong>Earlier this summer</strong>, a driver failed a left turn and plowed onto the sidewalk at East 149th and Courtlandt. Six people went down. The driver ran. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>Cops are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx, authorities said.</a></p><h3 id=the-system-moves-slow>The System Moves Slow</h3><p>The city finally funded a fix for the deadly intersection at East 177th, Devoe, and Tremont. It took seventeen years. In that time, two people died and more than three hundred were hurt. The city calls it an &ldquo;incredibly complex project.&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/city-commits-45-million-redo-dangerous-three-way-intersection-bronx>&ldquo;We are excited to make progress on this key corridor, which will make incredible pedestrian and vehicular safety improvements,&rdquo; said Ian Michaels.</a></p><p>But the dead do not care about complexity. They are gone. The living wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-and-police-can-do>What Leaders and Police Can Do</h3><p>Local leaders have the power. They can push for lower speed limits. They can demand street redesigns. They can fund enforcement. The police in Precinct 42 can crack down on speeding, reckless turns, and failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood is spilled again and again. They have the tools. They need to use them.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action. Demand speed enforcement, real fixes for deadly streets, and protection for every person who walks, rides, or waits at the curb. The next victim is only a day away.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
