The black Mercedes comes fast. It does not stop. He is thrown into the air, dragged half a block. The driver flees. His mother <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>said</a>, &ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</p><p>He was a father. His friend <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>said</a>, &ldquo;That was like my brother. He remember he was a good guy, a family guy. A whole father.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>4 people died</strong> and <strong>15 suffered serious injuries</strong> in Precinct 42. <strong>484 were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, parents, neighbors. The street does not care. The car does not care. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-that-wont-break>The Pattern That Won&rsquo;t Break</h3><p>The violence is not new. Since 2022, this precinct has seen <strong>11 killed</strong> and <strong>27 seriously injured</strong>. <strong>1447 people hurt</strong>. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Trucks, buses, mopeds, bikes—they all leave bodies behind.</p><p>Speed is the killer. In the last year, crashes rose. Injuries rose. Serious injuries rose. Only deaths dropped, but not enough. The pattern holds: the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-silence-and-the-tools>The Silence and the Tools</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep dying. But the work is not done until the dying stops.</p><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of safer streets. But the crosswalks are still stained. The cars still run. The families still grieve.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at every deadly corner. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p><strong>The dying will not stop until you make them stop.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
