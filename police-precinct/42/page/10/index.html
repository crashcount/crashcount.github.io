The crash occurred at 5:58 a.m. The report states the e-bike rider was traveling at 'unsafe speed' and 'disregarded traffic control.' The narrative details that the rider 'hit a parked Jeep at speed,' was 'ejected,' and 'died before dawn.' The police report notes the victim was wearing a helmet. The Jeep, registered in Pennsylvania, was parked and unoccupied at the time of the crash. The e-bike was described as 'demolished.' The police report centers contributing factors on 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' No driver error from the SUV is cited, as the vehicle was stationary.
