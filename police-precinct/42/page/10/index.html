Thirty seriously hurt. Over 1,500 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. Each one is a body on the street, a family left waiting for someone who will not come home. In the last year alone, five people died and thirteen suffered life-changing wounds. The violence does not slow. It does not wait for policy.</p><p><strong>Just last month</strong>, a driver in Morrisania struck and killed a car wash worker. Police say the driver veered her 2011 Ford Escape directly into the path of another car, pinning Felix Thomas Bontia and leaving him to die. She ran.

They can demand street redesigns. They can fund enforcement. The police in Precinct 42 can crack down on speeding, reckless turns, and failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood is spilled again and again. They have the tools. They need to use them.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action. Demand speed enforcement, real fixes for deadly streets, and protection for every person who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.
