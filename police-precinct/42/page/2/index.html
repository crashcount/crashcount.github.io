Same ending.</p><p>Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen on the Bronx River Parkway near E. 223rd St. He hit the car, then struck two riders. Both were thrown. Both died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, and he was released without bail, as the case continued. The victims were identified as 19‑year‑old Manuel Amarantepenalo and 21‑year‑old Enrique Martinez, both from the Bronx (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/11/bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>“Police have arrested and charged a man with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated,” reported one outlet (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>). “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” a family member said outside court (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>The southbound lanes closed near Exit 9 as the morning rush began. Another delay. Two funerals to follow (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/2-killed-1-taken-into-custody-in-multivehicle-bronx-river-parkway-crash-nypd-says>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Pain by the hour</p><p>In Precinct 42, the clock marks the damage. Nights are worst. Death spikes at 9 p.m. and past midnight. Three people died in the 9 p.m. hour. Two more at midnight. Another at 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. The bodies keep coming at 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The toll since 2022: 12 dead, 1,635 hurt. Pedestrians hit 330 times. Cyclists 137. Riders on small motors 65. Most harm comes from cars and SUVs (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Causes hide in plain sight. “Other” driver actions top the list in this precinct, tied to 8 deaths and 529 injuries. Distraction shows up. Failure to yield. Control disregarded. Speed listed again and again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Corners that don’t forgive</p><p>Some blocks draw blood. EAST 163 STREET leads the list with 62 injuries and four serious injuries. WEBSTER AVENUE follows with 51 injuries and three serious injuries. SOUTHERN BOULEVARD has a death. PARK AVENUE has two. WEBSTER AVE shows two more deaths on a different segment. These are not secrets. They are addresses (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Simple fixes exist. Daylight the corners. Give walkers a head start with signals. Harden left turns. Slow the straightaways where speed piles up. Focus truck turns where people cross. Target camera and officer enforcement to the late‑night hours when deaths surge (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Names in the ledger</p><p>A 31‑year‑old woman crossed with the signal at EAST 167 STREET and WASHINGTON AVENUE. An SUV going straight hit her. She died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4728165</a>).</p><p>A 24‑year‑old bicyclist on an e‑bike was struck near EAST 161 STREET and MELROSE AVENUE. The record notes “unsafe speed.” He wore a helmet. He still died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4705065</a>).</p><p>Two riders on the parkway didn’t make it home. Their families asked a simple thing: Why is he free? “How could they let him go?” a mother said outside court (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany renewed New York City’s school‑zone speed cameras around the clock through 2030. Cameras cut speeding where they go up. They work when leaders let them work (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>The city also has the power to lower speeds. Advocates are pressing for a default 20 mph limit on local streets and intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders. These measures save lives when used, and the ask is simple: use them (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><p>EAST 163 STREET. WEBSTER AVENUE. SOUTHERN BOULEVARD. Start with daylighting and hardened turns. Add head‑start signals for people on foot and bikes. Keep cameras hot after dark. Do it now, before the next name is logged (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Act</p><p>Two young men died on the parkway. Others died at the corner. The list will grow unless we force it to stop. Tell City Hall to slow the streets and rein in repeat speeders. Start here: <strong><a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></strong>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
