Same ending.</p><p>Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen on the Bronx River Parkway near E. 223rd St. He hit the car, then struck two riders. Both were thrown. Both died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, and he was released without bail, as the case continued. The victims were identified as 19‑year‑old Manuel Amarantepenalo and 21‑year‑old Enrique Martinez, both from the Bronx (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/11/bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>“Police have arrested and charged a man with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated,” reported one outlet (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>). “Two people were killed.

Nights are worst. Death spikes at 9 p.m. and past midnight. Three people died in the 9 p.m. hour. Two more at midnight. Another at 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. The bodies keep coming at 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The toll since 2022: 12 dead, 1,635 hurt. Pedestrians hit 330 times. Cyclists 137. Riders on small motors 65. Most harm comes from cars and SUVs (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Causes hide in plain sight. “Other” driver actions top the list in this precinct, tied to 8 deaths and 529 injuries. Distraction shows up. Failure to yield. Control disregarded.

EAST 163 STREET leads the list with 62 injuries and four serious injuries. WEBSTER AVENUE follows with 51 injuries and three serious injuries. SOUTHERN BOULEVARD has a death. PARK AVENUE has two.

They are addresses (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Simple fixes exist. Daylight the corners. Give walkers a head start with signals. Harden left turns. Slow the straightaways where speed piles up. Focus truck turns where people cross.

He still died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4705065</a>).</p><p>Two riders on the parkway didn’t make it home.
