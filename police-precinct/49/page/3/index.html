A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the riders. Both men died at the hospital. Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash shut down the highway for hours. The road was stained and silent.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, <strong>662 people were hurt in crashes in Precinct 49</strong>.

They can target the corners where blood pools most often. But the work is not done.
