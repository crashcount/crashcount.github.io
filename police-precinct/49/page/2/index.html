Twenty-two suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same again. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>A 91-year-old man was killed crossing at Rhinelander and Radcliff. He was working in the roadway. The car kept going straight. The man did not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>A cyclist, age 64, struck down at Williamsbridge and Pierce. A truck, a sedan, a bike. The crash left him dead. No helmet could save him. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—no one is spared.</strong> In the last year, 45 people under 18 were hurt. The old are not safe either. Eight people over 75 were injured. The violence is steady, unyielding.</p><h3 id=the-police-tools-in-hand-action-needed>The Police: Tools in Hand, Action Needed</h3><p>The police in Precinct 49 have the power to act. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But action is not a press release. It is a summons, a checkpoint, a patrol car parked where drivers race the light.</p><p>When an ambulance and a box truck collided at Pelham Parkway South and Williamsbridge, three people went to the hospital. The cause is still under investigation. The crash was not an act of God. It was a failure somewhere, by someone. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ambulance-box-truck-collide-injuring-3-people-morris-park-bronx/16177097/>&ldquo;Three people were hurt: the box truck driver and two ambulance workers.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A pedestrian was killed in a hit-and-run.

Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But laws do not save lives unless enforced. <strong>Every day of delay is another roll of the dice for a child in a crosswalk.</strong></p><p><strong>The police and local leaders must act.</strong> The tools are there. The blood is real. The time is now.</p><hr><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more from Precinct 49. Call your precinct. Call your council member. Tell them to enforce the law, slow the cars, and protect the people who walk and ride. Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
