Witnesses and video show a police van chasing a speeding Mercedes before the crash, raising questions about NYPD pursuit policy.

The NYPD’s policy restricts chases to serious crimes and discourages them in residential areas, yet the pursuit occurred near homes and a bodega. The department declined to comment.
