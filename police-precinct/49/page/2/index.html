Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass on the Bronx River Parkway near E. 223rd St. and set off a chain crash. Two motorcyclists went down and died. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, then released without bail while the case moves forward, according to press reports and prosecutors cited there. A sister stood outside court and said, “Two people were killed. He was drunk.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“How could they let him go?”</a> Her mother asked. The defense lawyer said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“My client is prepared to contest these charges.”</a> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>[NY Daily News, Aug. 12, 2025]</a>. Police records cited in coverage add that the driver had a strong odor of alcohol and refused a chemical test. The names of the dead: Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21 [(<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>).]</p><p>CBS said it plain: a Mercedes hit two men on scooters. Both died [(<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>CBS New York</a>).]</p><p>amNY reported the charges: vehicular manslaughter, DWI, DWAI. The Highway Collision Investigation Squad took the case [(<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>).]</p><h3 id=nights-are-loud-nights-are-lethal>Nights are loud. Nights are lethal.</h3><p>In Precinct 49, crashes pile up after dark. Injury counts peak late. Between 9 p.m. and midnight, injuries stayed high, and at 9 p.m. alone there were two deaths; another fell at 11 p.m. The 5 p.m. hour also saw a spike with one death and five serious injuries. Two more deaths hit at 8 a.m. and noon. This is not a fluke; it is a clock that keeps time with sirens [(<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).]</p><p>Contributing factors tell the same story. “Other,” the city’s catch‑all, sits on six deaths and 484 injuries. Failures at lights and stops add another death. Driver inattention racks up dozens of wounds. Unsafe speed shows up too. Human bodies lose every time [(<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).]</p><p>Pedestrians carry the worst of it.

The Bronx River Parkway is a top hotspot here, with three deaths and 111 injuries. Bronxdale Avenue is another, with 16 injuries and seven serious. East Gun Hill Road logs 52 injuries [(<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).]</p><p>Concrete moves save lives when they are built. Daylighting the corners on Bronxdale and Gun Hill. Hardened left turns where Williamsbridge meets Pierce, where a 64‑year‑old cyclist died in 2023 after a truck strike. Signal timing that gives people walking a head start. Calming the parkway’s feeders at exits near E. 223rd St. and Gun Hill. Focused night enforcement at the repeat hours. These are standard tools; the map tells you where to use them [(<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).]</p><p>In this precinct alone, a 91‑year‑old man working at an intersection died after being hit at Rhinelander and Radcliff in 2022. A moped rider died on Waring at Barker in 2024. A woman died on the parkway the same year in a speed crash. Names fade from the tape, but the corners stay the same [(<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash IDs</a>).]</p><h3 id=citywide-levers-we-can-pull-now>Citywide levers we can pull now</h3><p>The pattern will not break itself. Lower speeds save lives. The city has the power to set safer limits and should use it. Make 20 mph the rule on local streets. Pair it with cameras that never sleep and measures that stop the worst repeat offenders. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. With that in place, the next move is simple: set safer speeds everywhere and force the cars that rack tickets to slow down [(<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).]</p><p>One more step is on the table in Albany: require drivers with heavy point totals or camera violations to install speed limiters that cap the car at the limit plus five. The bill is called the Stop Super Speeders Act. A small group of drivers cause a large share of deaths. Take away their speed and you blunt their harm [(<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).]</p><h3 id=two-people-were-killed>“Two people were killed.”</h3><p>The sister’s words hang in the air. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“He was drunk.”</a> The lawyer’s words sit beside them: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“prepared to contest these charges.”</a> The road keeps humming.
