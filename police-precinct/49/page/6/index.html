The parkway ranks among the precinct’s top trouble spots, with 111 injuries and three deaths tallied in the period. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data lists BRONX RIVER PARKWAY as a hotspot</a>.</p><p>Nights cut deepest. Injuries spike between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m., with the worst hour at 9 p.m. and another peak at 7–8 a.m. Over the period, the 9 p.m. hour saw 96 injuries and two deaths; the 11 p.m. hour saw one more death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Precinct 49 hourly data shows these peaks</a>.</p><h3 id=where-streets-hurt-most>Where streets hurt most</h3><p>Bronxdale Avenue is another wound.

Daylight every corner near the parkway exits and on‑ramps. Add hardened left turns and longer leading intervals for people on foot at Bronxdale and along Rhinelander. Target late‑night speeding with focused operations at the 8 p.m.–1 a.m. peak. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data shows the locations and hours</a>.</p><p>Then widen the lens. The city has the tools to slow the fleet. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, and the city can lower limits. A citywide 20 mph default and cameras on all day and night cut risk. Our published guide explains how to press City Hall, DOT, and your Council office.
