A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the riders. Both men died at the hospital. Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash shut down the highway for hours. The road was stained and silent.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, <strong>662 people were hurt in crashes in Precinct 49</strong>. Thirteen suffered serious injuries. Two died. The numbers do not stop. They only rise and fall, like a tide that never recedes.</p><h3 id=vulnerable-on-every-street>Vulnerable on Every Street</h3><p>The dead are not just numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. In April, a cyclist was killed at Williamsbridge Road and Pierce Avenue. In November, a 91-year-old man was killed at Radcliff and Rhinelander. Most who die are not behind the wheel. They are walking, riding, or waiting to cross. The cars keep coming.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood pools most often. But the work is not done. Police said a Mercedes sedan driver struck two men on scooters, who then suffered fatal injuries, as reported by <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>CBS New York</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have passed new laws.

They have not acted fast enough.</p><p>Precinct 49 sits at the crossroads of the Bronx. The police can make a difference. The council can demand safer streets. The state can pass laws to stop repeat speeders. But every day of delay means another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words><strong>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member.
