Between 9 p.m. and midnight, injuries stayed high, and at 9 p.m. alone there were two deaths; another fell at 11 p.m. The 5 p.m. hour also saw a spike with one death and five serious injuries. Two more deaths hit at 8 a.m. and noon.

Failures at lights and stops add another death. Driver inattention racks up dozens of wounds. Unsafe speed shows up too.

Daylighting the corners on Bronxdale and Gun Hill. Hardened left turns where Williamsbridge meets Pierce, where a 64‑year‑old cyclist died in 2023 after a truck strike. Signal timing that gives people walking a head start. Calming the parkway’s feeders at exits near E. 223rd St. and Gun Hill. Focused night enforcement at the repeat hours.
