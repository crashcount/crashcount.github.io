Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash shut down the highway for hours. The road was stained and silent.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, <strong>662 people were hurt in crashes in Precinct 49</strong>.

They can target the corners where blood pools most often. But the work is not done.

The 22-year-old unlicensed driver was partially ejected and suffered severe bleeding to his arm. According to the police report, 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor. The Jeep was demolished. Parked sedans and an SUV were struck but had no occupants. No other injuries were reported. The police narrative describes the scene: 'A Jeep, speeding west, slammed parked cars. The unlicensed driver, 22, was flung halfway out, arm torn and bleeding. Airbag burst. Steel folded. The street stood silent, littered with glass and the smell of fuel.' Driver error—unsafe speed—was the primary cause. The driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
