A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the riders. Both men died at the hospital. Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash shut down the highway for hours. The road was stained and silent.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, <strong>662 people were hurt in crashes in Precinct 49</strong>.

In April, a cyclist was killed at Williamsbridge Road and Pierce Avenue. In November, a 91-year-old man was killed at Radcliff and Rhinelander. Most who die are not behind the wheel. They are walking, riding, or waiting to cross. The cars keep coming.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood pools most often. But the work is not done.
