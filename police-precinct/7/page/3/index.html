Fourteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Seven hundred sixty-seven injured since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are the old man crossing Delancey. The child struck on Water Street. The cyclist thrown on Pitt. The pain does not fade. It spreads.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths by SUV or car. Four more by truck or bus.

They can ticket speeders. They can stop drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at the corners where the blood pools and say, Not here, not again. But the silence is heavy. The tickets are few. The crashes keep coming.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> The city has new laws. Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. But change comes slow. Each delay means another family broken. Each excuse is a wound that does not heal.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices—by drivers, by leaders, by those who look away. If you want the killing to stop, do not wait. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand redesign. Demand that Precinct 7 use its power to protect the living.</p><p><strong>Do not let another name become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city’s pursuit toll grows.</p><p class=mb3>According to the NY Daily News (2024-12-18), a driver fleeing police in Greenwich Village struck a cyclist while speeding the wrong way on West Third Street. The article states, “A wrong-way driver fleeing from police struck a bicyclist in Greenwich Village during a chase.” The suspect, pursued on foot by officers, entered a black sedan and hit the cyclist before escaping. Emergency services brought the 44-year-old victim to Bellevue Hospital; he survived. The suspect remains at large. The piece notes a sharp rise in injuries from police pursuits: 398 crashes and 315 injuries in the first eleven months of 2024, up 47% from the previous year. The NYPD is revising its pursuit policy after ten deaths in cases where “no drugs or guns were found.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
