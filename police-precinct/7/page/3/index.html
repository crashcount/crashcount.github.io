The cyclist thrown on Pitt. The pain does not fade. It spreads.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths by SUV or car. Four more by truck or bus.

They can ticket speeders. They can stop drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at the corners where the blood pools and say, Not here, not again. But the silence is heavy. The tickets are few. The crashes keep coming.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> The city has new laws. Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. But change comes slow. Each delay means another family broken. Each excuse is a wound that does not heal.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices—by drivers, by leaders, by those who look away. If you want the killing to stop, do not wait. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand redesign. Demand that Precinct 7 use its power to protect the living.</p><p><strong>Do not let another name become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes.
