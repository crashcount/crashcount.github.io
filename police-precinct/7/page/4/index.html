The crash sent a 9-year-old boy, two women, and the driver to the hospital. NYPD officials stated, 'they did not suspect any criminality in the crash.' The driver reportedly suffered a medical episode, though police did not specify details, citing confidentiality laws. Four others refused medical attention at the scene. The incident highlights the ongoing risk to pedestrians from vehicles leaving the roadway, regardless of intent or cause.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.
