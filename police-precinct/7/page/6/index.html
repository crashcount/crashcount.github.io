Fourteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Seven hundred sixty-seven injured since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are the old man crossing Delancey. The child struck on Water Street. The cyclist thrown on Pitt. The pain does not fade. It spreads.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths by SUV or car. Four more by truck or bus.

The crashes keep coming.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> The city has new laws. Speed cameras.

They are choices—by drivers, by leaders, by those who look away. If you want the killing to stop, do not wait. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand redesign. Demand that Precinct 7 use its power to protect the living.</p><p><strong>Do not let another name become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
