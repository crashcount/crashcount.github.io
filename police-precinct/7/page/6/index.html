Fifteen serious injuries.</strong> Seven hundred ninety-five people hurt. This is not a tally from a war zone. This is Police Precinct 7 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><p>Just last year, a woman was killed crossing Delancey Street. She was 81. The driver was distracted. He turned right. She did not make it home. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> tells the story.</p><p>On July 4th, a pickup truck tore through a group of pedestrians on Water Street. Four people died. One was a child. The truck kept going straight. The people did not. No warning. No chance.</p><h2 id=the-dangers-multiply>The Dangers Multiply</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the killing.</strong> Eight deaths by truck, car, or SUV. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they hurt, but they do not kill at the same rate. The street is not fair. The bigger machine wins.</p><p>The violence is not always loud. Sometimes it is a van with 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline, rolling loose and striking a car with a woman and a child inside. &ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo; as <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>reported by NY Daily News</a>. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The victims survived. This time.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h2><p>The city has new tools. Lower speed limits. More speed cameras. But the pace is slow. The police can do more. They can crack down on speeding. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They have the power. They need to use it.</p><p>Community boards and advocates are pushing. &ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia</a>. The city listens, sometimes. But not enough. Not fast enough.</p><h2 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The unlicensed driver of a 2023 Nissan sedan was cited for unsafe lane changing and other vehicular contributing factors. This driver collided with other vehicles, including a 2012 Toyota and a 2018 Chevrolet, causing damage to their left front and right side doors respectively. A 27-year-old pedestrian, located off intersection and performing other actions in the roadway, was injured with contusions to the elbow and lower arm. A 27-year-old licensed male driver, wearing a lap belt and harness, also suffered abrasions to the elbow and lower arm. Both victims were conscious and sustained moderate injuries.
