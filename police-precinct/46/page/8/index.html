The report states the boy was crossing the street outside a crosswalk and without a signal when the SUV, traveling at an unsafe speed, hit him head-on. The impact caused severe bleeding from his arm, but he remained conscious at the scene. Police explicitly cite 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the crash. The driver was traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred, and the vehicle’s center front end struck the boy. The police report does not list any pedestrian actions as contributing factors, focusing solely on the driver’s unsafe speed. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of excessive speed on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
