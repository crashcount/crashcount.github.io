Since 2022, six people have died in crashes here. Twenty-two more have been seriously injured. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on the Major Deegan, on Jerome Avenue, on the Cross Bronx. They are children, elders, workers, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, 501 people were hurt—forty of them under eighteen. No one is spared.</p><p>Just days ago, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. His 71-year-old passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died. Seven others were hurt. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. The street does not care about age or reason. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-same-mistakes-again-and-again>The Same Mistakes, Again and Again</h2><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. Since 2022, they have killed three people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses have killed one, left others scarred. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all play a part, but the heaviest toll comes from the biggest machines. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><p>Last week, a Mustang mounted the curb and struck six people. The driver ran. &ldquo;EMS transported the six victims to Lincoln Hospital, where they were treated for minor injuries and were in stable condition, cops said,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>reported the Daily News</a>. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The car always wins.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—And What They Haven’t</h2><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, target crash hotspots. They can make the law mean something. But the carnage continues. Local leaders have spoken of Vision Zero, of new laws, of safer streets. But every week, the blood dries and the cycle repeats. The silence is loud. The delay is deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
