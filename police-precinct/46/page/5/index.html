One was a woman crossing the street. Some were just walking home. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>7 people suffered serious injuries</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed forever.</p><p>Just last week, two men on scooters were struck and killed on the Bronx River Parkway. Police <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>reported</a> that &ldquo;the men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo; The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash closed the highway for hours, but the loss will last much longer.</p><p>A few days before, a woman was hit by a turning car. She did not make it home. The street remembers. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Most of the dead and wounded are not behind the wheel.</strong> In this precinct, SUVs and sedans have done the most harm—<strong>3 deaths, 9 serious injuries, and 336 lesser injuries to pedestrians</strong>. Trucks killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens more hurt. A bike, a bus, a taxi—none are safe when the road is built for speed, not for people.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the work is not done. The numbers rise.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has passed laws. The state has handed New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is still too high. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><p>The silence from some leaders is loud. The action from others is slow. The dead do not wait for policy.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-act>Call to Action: Make Them Act</h3><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them you want speed limits enforced, reckless drivers off the street, and every crash hotspot fixed. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident, which occurred just after midnight on November 30, 2024, began when a BMW traveling east struck Berry’s pickup truck. The BMW then careened into parked vehicles, fatally striking Dwight Downer, a retired correction officer and high school football coach. Police say Berry fled the scene and was later charged with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. The BMW driver remained at the scene. The article quotes Downer’s sister: “He loved life.” The crash highlights ongoing risks at city intersections and the consequences of drivers fleeing after collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
