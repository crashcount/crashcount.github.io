One was a woman crossing the street. Some were just walking home. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>7 people suffered serious injuries</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed forever.</p><p>Just last week, two men on scooters were struck and killed on the Bronx River Parkway. Police <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>reported</a> that &ldquo;the men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo; The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash closed the highway for hours, but the loss will last much longer.</p><p>A few days before, a woman was hit by a turning car. She did not make it home. The street remembers. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Most of the dead and wounded are not behind the wheel.</strong> In this precinct, SUVs and sedans have done the most harm—<strong>3 deaths, 9 serious injuries, and 336 lesser injuries to pedestrians</strong>. Trucks killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens more hurt. A bike, a bus, a taxi—none are safe when the road is built for speed, not for people.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the work is not done. The numbers rise.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has passed laws. The state has handed New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is still too high. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><p>The silence from some leaders is loud. The action from others is slow. The dead do not wait for policy.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-act>Call to Action: Make Them Act</h3><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them you want speed limits enforced, reckless drivers off the street, and every crash hotspot fixed. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
