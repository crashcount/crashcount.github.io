Since 2022, seven people have died and 2,106 have been injured in crashes here. Thirty-three were left with serious injuries—lives changed in a heartbeat. The dead include a 10-year-old girl, a 46-year-old cyclist, and a 56-year-old man on a bike. Some were crossing with the light. Some were riding home. All are gone.</p><p>The numbers do not flinch.

The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Just last fall, a cyclist was killed at Union Avenue and Lynch Street.

They can target the corners where blood pools most often. But the work is slow. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>A mother’s voice breaks through the noise: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

The police can enforce the law. Local leaders can lower the speed limit. Residents can demand action. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand safer streets.
