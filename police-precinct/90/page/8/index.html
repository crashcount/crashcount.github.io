The vehicle involved was a 2011 Honda SUV traveling west, driven by an unlicensed male driver. The point of impact was the right front bumper of the SUV. The pedestrian sustained fractures and dislocations to the elbow, lower arm, and hand, classified as injury severity level 3. The report cites 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor but explicitly notes the driver was unlicensed, a critical driver error. The vehicle sustained no damage despite the collision. The pedestrian was conscious and not ejected from any vehicle. This incident underscores the systemic danger posed by unlicensed drivers operating vehicles in pedestrian-heavy areas.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
