A cyclist rides home. A man crosses with the light. In Precinct 90, these simple acts end in blood. <strong>Seven people killed. Thirty left with injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 566 people were hurt, 11 of them seriously. Two did not survive. The dead are not numbers. One was a ten-year-old girl, crushed by an SUV while crossing with the signal. Another, a cyclist, struck down and left with severe bleeding. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they left families with empty chairs. Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds, too, left their mark, but the weight of steel and speed is what breaks bodies. The latest headlines are blunt. A truck overturned on the BQE, injuring a person and scattering debris (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/05/one-person-injured-after-truck-flips-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>Truck Overturns, Injures One On BQE</a>). A three-year-old girl was knocked down by an e-bike on Bedford Avenue. The cyclist stayed. The child went to the hospital. &ldquo;The blow left the youngster with minor injuries to her lower stomach, and she was taken to Bellevue Hospital, cops said&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>E-Bike Hits Toddler in Brooklyn Lane</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Street redesigns. But in Precinct 90, the carnage continues. The police can enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people die. They just need to act. &ldquo;Unfortunately, somebody has to die before something gets done&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>City Closes Deadly Bushwick Intersection</a>).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. The precinct can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand more. But nothing changes unless you demand it. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Call the mayor. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
