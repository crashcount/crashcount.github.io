Thirty seriously hurt. Over 2,000 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, friends. They are the cost of walking, biking, or crossing the street in South and East Williamsburg.</p><p>A ten-year-old girl was crushed crossing with the light. A cyclist, helmet on, was thrown and killed at Union and Lynch. A man on a bike died under the wheels of a turning truck on Johnson Avenue. Each story ends the same way: a body in the road, a family left behind. The police report says &ldquo;failure to yield,&rdquo; &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-rollbacks-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Promises, Rollbacks, and Missed Chances</h2><p><strong>City Hall talks about safety. The mayor talks about safety. But the street tells a different story.</strong> In June, the city ripped out the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. The mayor called it a response to <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>safety concerns</a>. The rollback leaves riders exposed. The city admits the lane was meant to protect, but after crashes, they gave up. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, a three-year-old girl was hit by an e-bike in a bike lane, knocked down after stepping out from a double-parked car. She survived. Next time, maybe not. The city’s answer? A new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, rushed through after the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/citi-bike-rushes-to-add-speedometers-after-mayor-adams-orders-15-mph-e-bike-speed-limit>crash</a>.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-the-precinct-power-and-responsibility>The Role of the Precinct: Power and Responsibility</h2><p><strong>Precinct 90 has the power to act.</strong> Police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people die. They can treat every crash as a crime, not an accident. But they must choose to do it.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safe streets. Demand that every life counts. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
