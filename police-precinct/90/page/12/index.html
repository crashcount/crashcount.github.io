A motorcycle traveling south was changing lanes when it collided head-on with a northbound bicyclist. The bicyclist, a 44-year-old woman wearing a helmet, was ejected and sustained serious injuries to her abdomen and pelvis, along with abrasions. The report identifies the motorcycle driver's inattention and distraction as primary contributing factors, along with following too closely. The motorcycle showed no damage, while the bicycle sustained damage to its center front end. The report highlights driver errors—specifically failure to maintain attention and unsafe lane changes—as central to the crash, without attributing fault to the bicyclist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
