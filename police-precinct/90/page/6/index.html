Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,200 hurt since 2022. The streets do not forgive. They do not forget.</p><p>Just this spring, a 72-year-old man was killed crossing Scholes Street at Union Avenue. The car turned left. He never made it to the other side. In April, a ten-year-old girl was crushed by an SUV while crossing Wallabout Street with the signal. She died where she fell. The driver failed to yield. The city failed her too.</p><p>On Lynch Street, a cyclist was thrown and killed. The helmet did not save him. The cars did not stop. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-clear>The Pattern Is Clear</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They killed two. They left 213 others bleeding or broken. Trucks and buses injured 37 more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><p>The police know these corners. They know the hours when death comes. They have the power to act. They can ticket speeders. They can watch the crosswalks. They can slow the cars. But the numbers keep rising.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h3><p>Local leaders have the tools. The city can lower speed limits. The precinct can enforce them. But change crawls. <strong>&ldquo;I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Juan Ignacio Serra</a>. The city promises Vision Zero. The bodies say otherwise.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;In areas that were formally industrial—a lot of trucks, lot of heavy construction activity—that are becoming residential where cycling is more popular, we’re unfortunately seeing a lot of collisions with cyclists and trucks,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Polly Trottenberg</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

According to the police report, 'Both drivers ran the light.' The moped's rear was torn in the crash, and the rider was thrown from his seat, remaining conscious but badly injured. The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor for both vehicles involved. The moped operator was unlicensed, but the data centers driver actions: both failed to obey traffic signals, creating lethal conditions for all road users. The police report describes the aftermath in stark terms: 'Blood ran from deep cuts across his face.' No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the systemic danger when drivers ignore traffic controls at busy Brooklyn intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Both vehicles list 'Other Vehicular' as contributing factors, which, in this context, points to the truck's movement from parking as a critical action preceding the crash. The police narrative underscores the violence of the impact and the aftermath, with blood spreading on the blacktop.
