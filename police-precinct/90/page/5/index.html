Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,200 hurt since 2022. The streets do not forgive. They do not forget.</p><p>Just this spring, a 72-year-old man was killed crossing Scholes Street at Union Avenue. The car turned left. He never made it to the other side. In April, a ten-year-old girl was crushed by an SUV while crossing Wallabout Street with the signal. She died where she fell. The driver failed to yield. The city failed her too.</p><p>On Lynch Street, a cyclist was thrown and killed. The helmet did not save him. The cars did not stop. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-clear>The Pattern Is Clear</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They killed two. They left 213 others bleeding or broken. Trucks and buses injured 37 more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><p>The police know these corners. They know the hours when death comes. They have the power to act. They can ticket speeders. They can watch the crosswalks. They can slow the cars. But the numbers keep rising.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h3><p>Local leaders have the tools. The city can lower speed limits. The precinct can enforce them. But change crawls. <strong>&ldquo;I was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Juan Ignacio Serra</a>. The city promises Vision Zero. The bodies say otherwise.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;In areas that were formally industrial—a lot of trucks, lot of heavy construction activity—that are becoming residential where cycling is more popular, we’re unfortunately seeing a lot of collisions with cyclists and trucks,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>said Polly Trottenberg</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Grief and anger fill Borough Hall’s steps.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on April 1, 2025, that lawmakers are renewing calls for the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill after a Brooklyn crash killed a mother and two daughters, leaving a son in critical condition. The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Senator Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated violations or high point totals. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The article notes that similar measures, like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, have struggled with implementation. The crash highlights gaps in enforcement and policy, as auto deaths now outpace gun deaths in New York City for the second year running.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One SUV was stopped in traffic, while the other was parked. The cyclist was traveling straight ahead when the crash occurred. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver errors that led to the crash.
