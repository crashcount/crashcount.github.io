A cyclist rides home. A man crosses with the light. In Precinct 90, these acts end in blood. <strong>Seven people killed. Dozens left with wounds that may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, 566 people were hurt, 11 of them seriously. Two did not survive. The dead are not numbers. One was a ten-year-old girl, crushed by an SUV while crossing with the signal. Another, a cyclist, struck down and left with severe bleeding. The street does not forgive.</p><p>A new name joins the list. A three-year-old girl, knocked down by an e-bike on Bedford Avenue. The cyclist stayed. The child went to the hospital. &ldquo;The blow left the youngster with minor injuries to her lower stomach, and she was taken to Bellevue Hospital, cops said&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>E-Bike Hits Toddler in Brooklyn Lane</a>).</p><p>A truck overturned on the BQE, injuring a person and scattering debris (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/05/one-person-injured-after-truck-flips-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>Truck Overturns, Injures One On BQE</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They kill, they maim, they leave families with empty chairs. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds, too, leave their mark, but the weight of steel and speed is what breaks bodies.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Street redesigns. But in Precinct 90, the carnage continues. The police can enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people die. They just need to act. &ldquo;Unfortunately, somebody has to die before something gets done&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>City Closes Deadly Bushwick Intersection</a>).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. The precinct can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand more. But nothing changes unless you demand it. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Call the mayor. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

As the truck pulled out, a motorcycle traveling straight ahead collided with its side. The motorcyclist, age 47, was thrown from his vehicle and suffered severe lacerations to his leg, described as 'knee-lower leg foot' injuries, and was partially ejected but remained conscious. The report notes the truck sustained no damage, while the motorcycle's left front bumper took the impact. Both vehicles list 'Other Vehicular' as contributing factors, which, in this context, points to the truck's movement from parking as a critical action preceding the crash. The police narrative underscores the violence of the impact and the aftermath, with blood spreading on the blacktop. No driver errors beyond 'Other Vehicular' are specified, and no victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
