Police say the driver "sped through a red light" and fled. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch. A redesign with protected bike lanes was approved but stalled. State Sen. Gounardes criticized the city's response: "We should all be offended... the response... is a sign that says: 'be careful.'" The article highlights the need for enforcement and infrastructure, noting children must cross nine lanes daily.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
