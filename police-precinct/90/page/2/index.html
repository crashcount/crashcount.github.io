Thirty seriously hurt. Over 2,000 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, friends. They are the cost of walking, biking, or crossing the street in South and East Williamsburg.</p><p>A ten-year-old girl was crushed crossing with the light. A cyclist, helmet on, was thrown and killed at Union and Lynch. A man on a bike died under the wheels of a turning truck on Johnson Avenue. Each story ends the same way: a body in the road, a family left behind. The police report says &ldquo;failure to yield,&rdquo; &ldquo;driver inattention.&rdquo; The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-rollbacks-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Promises, Rollbacks, and Missed Chances</h2><p><strong>City Hall talks about safety. The mayor talks about safety. But the street tells a different story.</strong> In June, the city ripped out the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. The mayor called it a response to <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/protected-bike-lane-in-williamsburg-will-be-removed-mayor-says/>safety concerns</a>. The rollback leaves riders exposed. The city admits the lane was meant to protect, but after crashes, they gave up. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, a three-year-old girl was hit by an e-bike in a bike lane, knocked down after stepping out from a double-parked car. She survived. Next time, maybe not. The city’s answer? A new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, rushed through after the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/citi-bike-rushes-to-add-speedometers-after-mayor-adams-orders-15-mph-e-bike-speed-limit>crash</a>.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-the-precinct-power-and-responsibility>The Role of the Precinct: Power and Responsibility</h2><p><strong>Precinct 90 has the power to act.</strong> Police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people die. They can treat every crash as a crime, not an accident. But they must choose to do it.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safe streets. Demand that every life counts. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill.
