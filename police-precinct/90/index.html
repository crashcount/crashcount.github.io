Since 2022, seven people have died and 2,106 have been injured in crashes here. Thirty-three were left with serious injuries—lives changed in a heartbeat. The dead include a 10-year-old girl, a 46-year-old cyclist, and a 56-year-old man on a bike. Some were crossing with the light. Some were riding home. All are gone.</p><p>The numbers do not flinch.

The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Just last fall, a cyclist was killed at Union Avenue and Lynch Street.

They can target the corners where blood pools most often. But the work is slow. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>A mother’s voice breaks through the noise: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

The police can enforce the law. Local leaders can lower the speed limit. Residents can demand action. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand safer streets.

The lane, once shielded from traffic, will be replaced with an unprotected version. NY1 notes, 'The lane is being shifted from its current position next to the sidewalk to the other side of parked cars.' This change eliminates the physical barrier that separated cyclists from moving vehicles.

The fight over safety and street space continues. Cyclists and pedestrians wait as legal battles stall change.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on July 15, 2025, that an appellate judge halted Mayor Adams’s plan to remove a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan. The case underscores how political pressure and lax enforcement can threaten vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
