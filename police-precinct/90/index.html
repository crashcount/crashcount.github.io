The cyclist, a 32-year-old man, was ejected and suffered arm injuries. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Turning Improperly' contributed to the crash. 'View Obstructed/Limited' was also cited. The sedan’s left front bumper struck the cyclist as he made a left turn. The crash left the cyclist in shock and with abrasions.

The lane, once shielded from traffic, will be replaced with an unprotected version. NY1 notes, 'The lane is being shifted from its current position next to the sidewalk to the other side of parked cars.' This change eliminates the physical barrier that separated cyclists from moving vehicles. The move raises questions about city policy and the safety of vulnerable road users on this busy Brooklyn stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
