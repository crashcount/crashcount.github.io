They do not show the blood on the crosswalk or the shoes left behind.</p><p>Just last month, a 17-year-old was killed and a 14-year-old thrown from a moped on Avenue N. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Passing or Lane Usage Improper&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Trucks, buses, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of the harm is clear. The dead are not just numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors.</p><p>A neighbor, after a recent double fatality, put it plain: <strong>&ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>).

Still, the bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Speed cameras are renewed. But the pace of real change is slow. The police in Precinct 66 can enforce speed limits, crack down on reckless driving, and target the corners where people keep dying. They can write tickets for speeding, for failure to yield, for running red lights. They can make it stop. But only if they act.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement where it matters. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not words.
