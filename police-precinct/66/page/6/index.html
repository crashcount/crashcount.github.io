A car does not stop. In Precinct 66, this story repeats. <strong>Twenty people have died here since 2022. Sixteen more were left with injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the empty chair at dinner.</p><p>Just last week, a 70-year-old man was crossing Avenue I. A Smart Car driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>plowed into him</a>. The driver stayed. Dov Broyde did not. He died at the hospital. No charges were filed. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A 90-year-old man was left bleeding on the pavement after a masked moped rider <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>hit him and fled</a>. “He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The rider vanished. The man clings to life.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed seven people and injured over 500 more in this precinct. Trucks and buses killed two. Mopeds and motorcycles, one. Bikes, none. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has new tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower speed limits to 20 mph. The NYPD can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the pace is slow. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-role-of-the-precinct>The Role of the Precinct</h3><p>Precinct 66 has the power to act. They can enforce the law. They can write tickets for speeding, for failing to yield, for reckless turns. They can show up where the crashes happen, again and again. They can make it clear: the street is not a place to kill.</p><h3 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Ask for lower speed limits. Ask for real enforcement. Ask for streets where a walk to the store does not end in blood. The dead cannot speak. You can.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 66-year-old male pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a vehicle traveling southbound made a left turn and struck him with its left front bumper. The pedestrian sustained head injuries and abrasions and remained conscious. The report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor twice, highlighting the driver's failure to maintain focus during the maneuver. No other contributing factors, including pedestrian behavior, were noted. The crash underscores the dangers posed by distracted driving in intersections, especially during turning movements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
