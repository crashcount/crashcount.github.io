In the last twelve months alone, six more lives ended. <strong>Two of them were under 18.</strong></p><p>Last week, a BMW ran a red light at 3rd Avenue and 52nd Street. The driver struck two men, ages 80 and 59. Both died in the crosswalk. The driver fled. Police caught him later. The charges: manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving. &ldquo;Police said Juventino Anastacio-Florentino drove a BMW 328i through a red light&mldr; He struck two people crossing the intersection: Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59. Both were pronounced dead at the scene&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>according to Gothamist</a>.</p><p><strong>The horror is routine.</strong> A 70-year-old man killed crossing at Avenue I and East 5th. A 61-year-old man dead at Bay Parkway and 60th. A 17-year-old thrown from a moped, dead on Avenue N. The list does not end.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, 8 came from cars and SUVs, 2 from trucks and buses, 1 from mopeds, none from bikes. The old, the young, the poor—no one is spared. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones. We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest to ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, target crash hotspots. But the deaths keep coming. Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer street design. They can call for real enforcement—not just against cyclists and delivery workers, but against the drivers who kill.</p><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The numbers are not fate. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more from Precinct 66.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them to crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. Tell them to protect the people who walk and bike these streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
