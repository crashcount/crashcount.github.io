A blue moped hit him and kept going. His head struck the pavement. He died at the hospital. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>described</a> the scene: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open. It was a blue scooter. The driver had a mask. He hit the guy and he left.&rdquo;</p><p>He is not alone. In the last twelve months, five people have died in Precinct 66. Six were seriously injured. <strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are all at risk.</strong> Two children died. One woman was crushed by a turning SUV. A teenager on a bike was killed by a truck. The numbers do not stop. In three and a half years, this precinct has seen 20 deaths and 16 serious injuries, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are the old man on the corner, the child on a bike, the woman in the crosswalk. &ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a> after the latest hit-and-run.</p><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars, SUVs, and trucks.</strong> But mopeds and bikes are not harmless. In this precinct, SUVs and cars caused seven deaths and five serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed two and seriously injured one. Mopeds and motorcycles left one dead and one seriously hurt. Bikes injured 25 people. No one is safe when the street is lawless.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p>Local leaders have the power to change this. They can lower speed limits. They can demand enforcement at crash hotspots. They can push for real penalties for hit-and-run drivers. They can fight for protected crossings and daylighted corners. <strong>But too often, the response is slow.</strong></p><p>The police in Precinct 66 have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless turns and failure to yield. They can target the corners where people keep dying. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safe crossings. Demand action before another neighbor dies. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Life ended in seconds.</p><p class=mb3>A deadly crash unfolded on McDonald Avenue near Bay Parkway in Brooklyn when a van, traveling south, changed lanes unsafely and struck a station wagon/SUV, according to the police report. The report states, "A van veered, struck a station wagon. The SUV’s driver, 54, died belted in place. The airbag burst. His body broke inside." The driver of the SUV was killed, suffering injuries to his entire body despite the deployment of the airbag and use of a lap belt. Two others were in the van. The police report explicitly cites "Unsafe Lane Changing" as the contributing factor. The van’s pre-crash action is listed as "Changing Lanes," and the point of impact was the center front end. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the van driver’s unsafe maneuver, which led directly to the fatal outcome.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
