They never made it to the other side. The driver who killed them was moving at 68 miles per hour—almost triple the speed limit. She ran two red lights, never touched the brakes, and drove with a suspended license. Her car had racked up 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. The black box told the story. The city did nothing until it was too late. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/16/miriam-yarimi-driver-accused-killing-brooklyn-mom-and-two-kids-in-person-court-appearance/>Brooklyn D.A. Eric Gonzalez called it</a> “one of the worst collisions I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a New York City street.”</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people died</strong> on the streets of Precinct 66. <strong>Six were left with serious injuries.</strong> Children, elders, men, women. One child dead. One elder dead. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and trucks crush bones and end lives.</strong> In this precinct, SUVs and cars killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two. Cars, vans, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all take their share. But the big machines do the most damage. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the numbers</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h2><p>The law now lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city could do it today. It has not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, reckless driving. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act.</p><p>After the deaths on Ocean Parkway, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/brooklyn-drival-fatal-collision-midwood/>Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said</a>, “This defendant’s unconscionably dangerous driving wiped out a family.” He called for full accountability. But words do not bring back the dead. Cameras, tickets, and laws mean nothing if leaders do not use them.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> The police must enforce the law. The city must lower the speed limit. The state must protect speed cameras. Residents must demand action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them: enough.</p><p><strong>If you wait, the blood will not stop.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
