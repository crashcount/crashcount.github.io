Sixteen more suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. In the last year alone, five lives ended, including two children. <strong>657 people were hurt.</strong></p><p>The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the crash. They do not tell you about the shoes left behind, or the families waiting in hospital rooms. But the numbers do not lie. They show a disaster that does not stop.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused seven deaths and over 500 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death rolls on four wheels. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street—none are spared.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Just last November, a van changed lanes on Bay Parkway and killed a 54-year-old man. His passenger was left with broken bones. The crash report lists the cause as &ldquo;unsafe lane changing&rdquo;—a phrase that means nothing to the dead (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Last summer, a 16-year-old boy was crushed by a truck while riding his bike at Coney Island Avenue and Ditmas. He never made it home. The truck was turning right. The boy was in the way.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p>The police in Precinct 66 have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people keep dying. But the bodies keep piling up. The law is only as strong as its enforcement.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer street designs. They can call out delay and demand action. But every day of silence is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>A crash does not end when the sirens fade. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop.
