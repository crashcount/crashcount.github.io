Since 2022, <strong>21 people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Six in the last year alone.</strong> The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man who never made it across Avenue U, the teen thrown from a moped, the woman crushed by an SUV. The ground remembers every one.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was killed crossing East 14th Street.</strong> A blue moped hit him and kept going. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said, &ldquo;He hit the guy and he left.&rdquo;</a> The man died at the hospital. His family waits for answers. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-vulnerable-lives-unforgiving-roads>The Pattern: Vulnerable Lives, Unforgiving Roads</h3><p>In the last 12 months, <strong>children and elders have paid the highest price</strong>. Two kids and three people over 55 killed. <strong>Pedestrians take the brunt.</strong> SUVs and sedans do most of the damage—<strong>8 deaths, 5 serious injuries</strong>—but mopeds, trucks, and bikes leave their own scars. The numbers do not lie: <strong>over 2,200 injured</strong> since 2022, with 16 left with life-changing wounds.</p><p>The stories repeat. A masked rider. A driver not looking. A body on the pavement. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>&ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo;</a> said a neighbor. But it does. Again and again.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-delays-and-what-must-change>Leadership: Promises, Delays, and What Must Change</h3><p>The city has new laws. Speed limits can drop. Cameras can catch speeders. But in Precinct 66, the pace is slow. <strong>No bold local action. No surge in enforcement.</strong> The police have the tools: they can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, target the corners where people die. They just need to use them.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand real enforcement.</strong> Tell them the deaths must stop. Tell them to use every tool—speeding tickets, failure-to-yield crackdowns, hotspot patrols. <strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police said 44-year-old Laura Cordova was driving without a license and without a court-mandated ignition interlock device. The crash happened near Tillary Street just before 10 p.m. on May 10, when 27-year-old Sean Johnson, riding a Suzuki motorcycle, collided with Cordova’s stopped Honda Accord. Johnson was found in critical condition and later died at Brooklyn Hospital Center. The article notes, 'Police arrested 44-year-old Laura Cordova... for driving without a license and using a vehicle without ignition interlock.' The NYPD Highway Collision Investigation Squad is still investigating.

He refused a Breathalyzer test at the scene. He was charged with driving while intoxicated, driving while impaired, and refusing the test. The Department of Education referred questions to the NYPD.

Prosecutors say Yarimi sped through a red light, collided with another car, and hit the family, killing Saada and two daughters. Her son remains in a coma. Yarimi’s license was suspended and her car had nearly $11,000 in violations, including 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. Black box data revealed Yarimi never braked. Brooklyn D.A. Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst collisions I've ever seen on a New York City street.' Yarimi faces charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and assault, highlighting systemic failures in license enforcement and traffic violation accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Epps, unlicensed, "blew a stop sign" and struck a school bus, killing his passenger, Imani Vance, and injuring the bus driver. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant's reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds." Epps left the scene, tried to escape in an Uber, and was arrested after fleeing on foot. The crash was one of three fatal Brooklyn incidents that weekend. City data cited in the article shows ongoing danger: at least 15 killed in Kings County so far this year, with thousands injured, often due to driver inattention and failure to yield.
