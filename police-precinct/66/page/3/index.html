In the last twelve months alone, six more lives ended. <strong>Two of them were under 18.</strong></p><p>Last week, a BMW ran a red light at 3rd Avenue and 52nd Street. The driver struck two men, ages 80 and 59. Both died in the crosswalk. The driver fled. Police caught him later. The charges: manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving. &ldquo;Police said Juventino Anastacio-Florentino drove a BMW 328i through a red light&mldr; He struck two people crossing the intersection: Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59. Both were pronounced dead at the scene&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>according to Gothamist</a>.</p><p><strong>The horror is routine.</strong> A 70-year-old man killed crossing at Avenue I and East 5th. A 61-year-old man dead at Bay Parkway and 60th. A 17-year-old thrown from a moped, dead on Avenue N. The list does not end.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, 8 came from cars and SUVs, 2 from trucks and buses, 1 from mopeds, none from bikes. The old, the young, the poor—no one is spared. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones. We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest to ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, target crash hotspots. But the deaths keep coming. Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer street design. They can call for real enforcement—not just against cyclists and delivery workers, but against the drivers who kill.</p><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The numbers are not fate. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more from Precinct 66.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them to crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. Tell them to protect the people who walk and bike these streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police say Brod had the light. The driver, Menachem Shagalow, 65, was unlicensed and charged with aggravated unlicensed operation and failure to exercise due care. The article quotes Brod's grandson: "She was extremely independent till her last day." Brod died less than two weeks after the crash. The incident highlights ongoing risks for pedestrians, especially from unlicensed drivers. Shagalow was released with a desk appearance ticket.

Prosecutors allege Yarimi drove nearly 70 mph, ran red lights, and turned right on red with a suspended license and dozens of prior speeding tickets. She struck a for-hire car, then hit Natasha Saada and her three children, killing the mother and two daughters. The surviving son remains in a coma. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'among the worst collisions he has seen in his 25 years.' The article notes that advocates are pushing for laws requiring speed-limiters on cars of repeat speeders. Yarimi awaits trial, facing up to 15 years if convicted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
