Third Avenue and 52nd Street. A BMW ran the red. Two men crossing the street—Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59—never made it to the other side. The car did not stop. Both men died in the crosswalk. The driver was caught later, charged with manslaughter and reckless driving. Police said the car was &ldquo;speeding southbound&rdquo; and &ldquo;did not brake before impact&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>Neighbors saw it coming. &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,&rdquo; one <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>told reporters</a>. The numbers back them up. In the last five years, the three blocks around that corner saw 59 crashes and about 80 injuries. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=the-toll-in-blood-and-bone>The Toll in Blood and Bone</h3><p><strong>In the past twelve months, six people have died in crashes in Precinct 66.</strong> Another 679 were injured. Children, elders, men and women. Two children under 18 are among the dead. The old are not spared: one death each in the 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and 65–74 age groups. Serious injuries cut across every age.</p><p>The killers are not ghosts. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm—eight deaths, 533 injuries.</strong> Trucks and buses killed two, injured 48. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more hurt. The numbers do not lie. The street is a weapon in the wrong hands.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras. Lower limits. Crackdowns on reckless driving. But the carnage continues. Police have the power to enforce the law, to ticket speeders, to target known hotspots. They know where the bodies fall. They know who is most at risk.</p><p>Local leaders have spoken about Vision Zero. They have passed bills. But the deaths do not stop. The street does not care about promises. It cares about action. <strong>Every day without enforcement is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.</strong></p><p>The street will not change itself. Only people can do that. Only you can make them act.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
