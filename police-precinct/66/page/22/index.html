Sixteen more suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. In the last year alone, five lives ended, including two children. <strong>657 people were hurt.</strong></p><p>The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the crash. They do not tell you about the shoes left behind, or the families waiting in hospital rooms. But the numbers do not lie. They show a disaster that does not stop.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused seven deaths and over 500 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death rolls on four wheels. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street—none are spared.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Just last November, a van changed lanes on Bay Parkway and killed a 54-year-old man.

They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people keep dying. But the bodies keep piling up. The law is only as strong as its enforcement.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer street designs.

According to the police report, a 21-year-old e-bike rider, unlicensed and unhelmeted, was struck head-on by an unlicensed SUV. The rider was ejected, left unconscious, and suffered severe head bleeding. The SUV carried two occupants, both unlicensed. The report states, 'Traffic control disregarded.' This failure to obey traffic signals or signs was listed as the primary contributing factor for all involved. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the systemic disregard for traffic control. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers ignore basic rules and operate vehicles without licenses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
