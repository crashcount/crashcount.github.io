It’s math.</p><ul><li>From 2022 to now, crashes stack up at midday and late afternoon. Deaths spike at 1 p.m., 3 p.m., and again from 6–9 p.m. The clock tells on us. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly distribution</a> shows the peaks.</li></ul><p>Three corners.

Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The call is simple: default <strong>20 mph</strong> on local streets. Our own coverage lays out the steps to push City Hall. See <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>A few drivers do most of the harm. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force chronic violators to use speed limiters. The case is made in our <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a> brief with linked research.</li></ul><p>Make the turns safe.</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Fort Hamilton and Caton. Harden right turns where trucks sweep wide. Give walkers a head start with LPIs at the worst crossings. Use 24/7 camera enforcement where injuries pool. These are standard tools. This precinct needs them at its repeat sites, including <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Fort Hamilton Parkway</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Caton Avenue</a>.</li></ul><p>The last word should be the city’s. Instead, it’s the coroner’s.</p><ul><li>“A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said in a separate Brooklyn case this month.
