Since 2022, <strong>21 people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Six in the last year alone.</strong> The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man who never made it across Avenue U, the teen thrown from a moped, the woman crushed by an SUV. The ground remembers every one.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was killed crossing East 14th Street.</strong> A blue moped hit him and kept going. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said, &ldquo;He hit the guy and he left.&rdquo;</a> The man died at the hospital. His family waits for answers. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-vulnerable-lives-unforgiving-roads>The Pattern: Vulnerable Lives, Unforgiving Roads</h3><p>In the last 12 months, <strong>children and elders have paid the highest price</strong>. Two kids and three people over 55 killed. <strong>Pedestrians take the brunt.</strong> SUVs and sedans do most of the damage—<strong>8 deaths, 5 serious injuries</strong>—but mopeds, trucks, and bikes leave their own scars. The numbers do not lie: <strong>over 2,200 injured</strong> since 2022, with 16 left with life-changing wounds.</p><p>The stories repeat. A masked rider. A driver not looking. A body on the pavement. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>&ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo;</a> said a neighbor. But it does. Again and again.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-delays-and-what-must-change>Leadership: Promises, Delays, and What Must Change</h3><p>The city has new laws. Speed limits can drop. Cameras can catch speeders. But in Precinct 66, the pace is slow. <strong>No bold local action. No surge in enforcement.</strong> The police have the tools: they can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, target the corners where people die. They just need to use them.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand real enforcement.</strong> Tell them the deaths must stop. Tell them to use every tool—speeding tickets, failure-to-yield crackdowns, hotspot patrols. <strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
