Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,100 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars. The streets do not forgive.</p><p>Just last November, a van changed lanes on Bay Parkway. The driver died. His passenger was left with broken bones and pain that will not fade. The crash was not an act of God. It was a man behind the wheel, a van, a choice, and a street that let it happen. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-usual-weapons-suvs-trucks-and-speed>The Usual Weapons: SUVs, Trucks, and Speed</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm</strong>—seven killed, over 500 injured. Trucks and buses killed two, injured dozens. Motorcycles and mopeds left more bodies and broken bones. Bikes, too, are not spared. The pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the heavier the toll.</p><p>The pain is not abstract. A witness at one crash <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>described</a>, &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth.&rdquo; There is no comfort in numbers. Only the cold fact that the street is dangerous, and the danger is allowed to remain. &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said a neighbor</a> after a boy was killed by an SUV.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The police in Precinct 66 have the power to act. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target the corners where people keep dying. They can treat traffic violence as the crime it is. But the silence is loud. The numbers keep rising. The bodies keep coming. <strong>Leadership is measured in lives saved, not words spoken.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone, and a system that lets it happen. If you want change, demand it. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Stand with the families who have lost. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A female driver, making a right turn, struck the left rear quarter panel of a sedan traveling straight ahead. The contributing factor cited was driver inattention/distraction.

Both were conscious and restrained with lap belts and airbags deployed. The report explicitly notes driver distraction as the cause, with no other contributing factors listed.
