Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,100 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, elders, riders, walkers. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 17-year-old was killed on Avenue N. His 14-year-old passenger was thrown from the moped and left unconscious, pelvis shattered. The crash involved a sedan, a moped, and a parked SUV. The boy did not come home. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Last May, a 38-year-old woman died at Ditmas Avenue.
