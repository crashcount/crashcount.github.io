Since 2022, 20 people have died in crashes here. Sixteen more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. In the past year alone, two children died. One was just a boy. His life ended under the wheels of a car. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families torn open.</p><p>Last week, a 17-year-old boy died on a moped. He was thrown from the seat, his passenger left fighting for life. &ldquo;Jhoan later died at the hospital,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>said police</a>. No arrests. No comfort. Only the sound of sirens and the scrape of glass on asphalt.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They killed seven people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds left one dead, many hurt. Bikes caused injuries, but not a single death. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city passed new laws. Speed cameras now watch day and night. The law allows lower speed limits. But in Precinct 66, the carnage continues. The police have the power to act. They can ticket speeders, stop reckless drivers, and protect the crosswalks. But the blood keeps flowing. &ldquo;He was a boy who loved life,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said Baila Krainer</a>. The city mourns, then moves on.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>Precinct 66 can do more. The police can target crash hotspots. They can enforce speed limits and failure-to-yield laws. They can make it clear: these are not accidents. They are preventable deaths. But only if someone cares enough to stop them.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action. Every day of delay is another day a child might not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
