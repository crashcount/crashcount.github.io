In the last twelve months alone, six more lives ended. <strong>Two of them were under 18.</strong></p><p>Last week, a BMW ran a red light at 3rd Avenue and 52nd Street. The driver struck two men, ages 80 and 59. Both died in the crosswalk. The driver fled. Police caught him later. The charges: manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving. &ldquo;Police said Juventino Anastacio-Florentino drove a BMW 328i through a red light&mldr; He struck two people crossing the intersection: Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59. Both were pronounced dead at the scene&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>according to Gothamist</a>.</p><p><strong>The horror is routine.</strong> A 70-year-old man killed crossing at Avenue I and East 5th. A 61-year-old man dead at Bay Parkway and 60th. A 17-year-old thrown from a moped, dead on Avenue N. The list does not end.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, 8 came from cars and SUVs, 2 from trucks and buses, 1 from mopeds, none from bikes. The old, the young, the poor—no one is spared. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones. We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest to ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, target crash hotspots. But the deaths keep coming. Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, safer street design. They can call for real enforcement—not just against cyclists and delivery workers, but against the drivers who kill.</p><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The numbers are not fate. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more from Precinct 66.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them to crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. Tell them to protect the people who walk and bike these streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled.

The fight for safe passage on Bedford Avenue continues in court.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 18, 2025, that Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo halted New York City's plan to remove three blocks of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger. The case highlights the need for transparent processes and the risks when safety infrastructure is hastily altered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule. The move highlights rising e-bike use and the city’s struggle to manage micromobility safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
