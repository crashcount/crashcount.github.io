Since January 2022, <strong>21 people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Sixteen more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not tell the whole story. They do not show the blood on the crosswalk or the shoes left behind.</p><p>Just last month, a 17-year-old was killed and a 14-year-old thrown from a moped on Avenue N. The cause: <strong>&ldquo;Passing or Lane Usage Improper&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The street was quiet after. The loss was not.</p><p>In April, a 61-year-old man was killed crossing Bay Parkway. The SUV kept going straight. He did not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-pattern-is-clear>The Pattern Is Clear</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, SUVs and sedans are responsible for the largest share. Trucks, buses, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of the harm is clear. The dead are not just numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors.</p><p>A neighbor, after a recent double fatality, put it plain: <strong>&ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>). The police know the hotspots. The city knows the patterns. Still, the bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Speed cameras are renewed. But the pace of real change is slow. The police in Precinct 66 can enforce speed limits, crack down on reckless driving, and target the corners where people keep dying. They can write tickets for speeding, for failure to yield, for running red lights. They can make it stop. But only if they act.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement where it matters. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not words. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
