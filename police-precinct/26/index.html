But the numbers do not comfort. 154 people were injured. Two were left with serious wounds. In three and a half years, four people died. 584 were hurt. Seven suffered injuries that change a life. The youngest victim was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. The street does not care.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Fourteen pedestrians struck by sedans. Seven by SUVs.

An NYPD squad car, lights flashing, swerved to avoid a taxi. The car jumped the curb. The diners went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failure to yield. The police said, “<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway in Morningside Heights around 4:10 p.m. when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street</a>.”</p><p>The investigation is ongoing. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood is spilled again and again. They just need to act.</p><p>Mayor Adams <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said</a> &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The words are right. The action is slow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more>What Comes Next: Demand More</h3><p>Precinct 26 can do more. Lower the speed limit. Enforce it. Protect the crosswalks. Ticket the drivers who treat the street like a racetrack. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them the numbers are not enough. The pain is real. The time is now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon said, "One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals." The crash blocked a key entrance, forcing bus reroutes and causing major delays. The article highlights the challenge of emergency access at this location and the disruption to transit. No details on specific driver actions were given, but the incident underscores risks at crowded transit hubs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains where cars and bikes must mix.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-13) reports that city officials will not build a protected bike lane through the 79th Street Rotunda, despite years of requests from Manhattan Community Board 7. Cyclists using the Hudson River greenway must share space with highway-bound vehicles. The $150-million project includes only a painted, unprotected lane. DOT official Colleen Chattergoon said, "With the space that we have, we cannot accommodate a protected bike lane in that area." The city has not acted on a 2019 resolution calling for real protection. Community members and advocates question the safety of the design, especially for children. Officials promised to review the resolution but gave no timeline or details. The plan leaves cyclists exposed to fast-moving traffic, highlighting ongoing policy gaps in street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."
