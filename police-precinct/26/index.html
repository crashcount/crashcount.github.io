But the numbers do not comfort. 154 people were injured. Two were left with serious wounds. In three and a half years, four people died. 584 were hurt. Seven suffered injuries that change a life. The youngest victim was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. The street does not care.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Fourteen pedestrians struck by sedans. Seven by SUVs. Four by taxis. Three by bikes. One by a truck. The rest, lost in the data. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-safe-place>The Latest Crashes: No Safe Place</h3><p>On May 26, two people sat at an outdoor table on Broadway. An NYPD squad car, lights flashing, swerved to avoid a taxi. The car jumped the curb. The diners went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failure to yield. The police said, “<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway in Morningside Heights around 4:10 p.m. when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street</a>.”</p><p>The investigation is ongoing. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood is spilled again and again. They just need to act.</p><p>Mayor Adams <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said</a> &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The words are right. The action is slow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more>What Comes Next: Demand More</h3><p>Precinct 26 can do more. Lower the speed limit. Enforce it. Protect the crosswalks. Ticket the drivers who treat the street like a racetrack. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them the numbers are not enough. The pain is real. The time is now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van.

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.
