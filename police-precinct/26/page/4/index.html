Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

The report states the SUV had four occupants and was traveling straight ahead when it collided with the cyclist, who was also moving straight. The cyclist was ejected on impact, suffering a severe head injury and heavy bleeding. Police list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor for the crash, placing responsibility on the SUV driver’s lack of focus. The report also notes the cyclist was listening to headphones and not wearing a helmet, but these details are cited only after the driver’s error. The collision’s violence and aftermath underscore the dangers faced by vulnerable road users when drivers fail to pay attention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
