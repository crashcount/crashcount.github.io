But the numbers do not comfort. 154 people were injured. Two were left with serious wounds. In three and a half years, four people died. 584 were hurt. Seven suffered injuries that change a life. The youngest victim was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. The street does not care.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. Fourteen pedestrians struck by sedans. Seven by SUVs. Four by taxis. Three by bikes. One by a truck. The rest, lost in the data. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-safe-place>The Latest Crashes: No Safe Place</h3><p>On May 26, two people sat at an outdoor table on Broadway. An NYPD squad car, lights flashing, swerved to avoid a taxi. The car jumped the curb. The diners went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failure to yield. The police said, “<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway in Morningside Heights around 4:10 p.m. when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street</a>.”</p><p>The investigation is ongoing. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood is spilled again and again. They just need to act.</p><p>Mayor Adams <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said</a> &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The words are right. The action is slow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more>What Comes Next: Demand More</h3><p>Precinct 26 can do more. Lower the speed limit. Enforce it. Protect the crosswalks. Ticket the drivers who treat the street like a racetrack. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them the numbers are not enough. The pain is real. The time is now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
