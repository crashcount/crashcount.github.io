Six seriously hurt.</strong> In the past three and a half years, this is the price Precinct 22 has paid for moving through its streets. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. In June, a 43-year-old man was killed riding an e-bike on the 97th Street Transverse. In January last year, a 60-year-old man died at the intersection of Central Park North and Powell Boulevard, struck by a garbage truck. The city keeps moving. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=the-dangers-multiply>The Dangers Multiply</h3><p><strong>Bikes, trucks, cars, and buses all draw blood here.</strong> In this precinct, bikes caused 10 pedestrian injuries, including two serious. Cars and SUVs left 21 people hurt, one seriously. Trucks and buses killed one and injured three more. Motorcycles and mopeds added four more injuries. No one is spared. Not the young, not the old. In the last year alone, a child crossing with the signal was struck by a cyclist at Central Park West and 85th. The crash left her with a severe head wound. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. But the work is not done. The city talks of Vision Zero. The deaths keep coming. After a near collision in Lower Manhattan, a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>described the scene</a>: &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something.&rdquo; Another voice cut through the noise: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always something in this city. Bright and early, like 6-something in the morning. It&rsquo;s crazy&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said another witness</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death, every injury, is a choice made by leaders who look away or move too slow. <strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them you want speed limits enforced, reckless drivers off the street, and real protection for people walking and biking. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Gale Brewer criticized the move, stating, "A civil summons is a more appropriate response and thrusting people into the criminal justice system unnecessarily is bad public policy." The article notes that some officers issued summonses for actions legalized in 2019, such as cyclists proceeding with a pedestrian walk signal. Many tickets were dismissed in court due to errors by police. A class action lawsuit has been filed by a cyclist ticketed for a legal maneuver. The crackdown raises questions about enforcement priorities and the risk of criminalizing vulnerable road users instead of addressing systemic dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes.
