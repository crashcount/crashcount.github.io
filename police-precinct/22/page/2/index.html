A truck does not stop. In January 2023, a 60-year-old pedestrian was killed at Central Park North and Powell Boulevard. Head trauma. Internal bleeding. He died at the intersection, another name lost to the city’s traffic tally. The truck kept going straight. The man did not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>38 people were injured and one was seriously hurt</strong> in crashes across Precinct 22. No deaths this year, but the scars remain. Cyclists, walkers, children—none are spared. A 57-year-old woman bled in the road after a bike struck her near Heckscher Fields. A 53-year-old cyclist was ejected and left semiconscious after an SUV hit him on Central Park West. The numbers are small. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=horses-carriages-and-panic>Horses, Carriages, and Panic</h2><p>The old dangers remain. In May, two horse-drawn carriages collided in Central Park. Both operators went to the hospital. The horses survived. The city was lucky this time. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/collision-between-horse-drawn-carriages-central-park-sends-operators-hospital/16559383/>Police say the operators are expected to be okay, and the horses were not severely injured.</a> But luck is not a plan. Days earlier, a runaway carriage horse tore through the park, scattering walkers. &ldquo;I was there with my friend walking on the sidewalk and almost got trampled by the poor horse. It was so terrifying,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/19/us-news/central-park-horse-runs-wild-without-driver-in-shocking-video/>said Hayley</a>. No one died. This time.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run 24/7. The law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Precinct 22, the pace of change is slow. One death. Dozens hurt. The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They just need to use them.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every injury is a warning. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where a walk in the park does not end in blood.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries.
