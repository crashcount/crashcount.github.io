Since 2022, <strong>2 people have died</strong> and <strong>6 have been seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>230 more have been hurt</strong>. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was killed on the 97th Street Transverse. He was 43. The crash report lists only the facts: head injury, ejected, dead. No story, no name. Only the end. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A pedestrian was struck by a bike at Central Park West and 85th.

The bike kept going. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>In Central Park, the violence hides in plain sight.

But in this precinct, the carnage continues. Local leaders have the power to demand more enforcement, more daylighting, more protection for those on foot and bike. They can push for real change, not just numbers on a page.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct.
