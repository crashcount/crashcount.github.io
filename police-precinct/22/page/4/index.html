Seven left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, fifty-two more were hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. Children, the old, the ones on foot or on two wheels—they bleed first.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a cyclist was hit and left in the street in Washington Heights. The driver fled. The neighbors did not mince words. <em>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nita</a>. The intersection had been a problem for years. The city knew. The police knew. Still, the blood dries and the cars keep moving.</p><h3 id=patterns-not-accidents>Patterns, Not Accidents</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> In the last year, one person died in this precinct. Three more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are up. Crashes rose by 15% over last year. Serious injuries doubled. The dead do not get second chances.</p><p>The killers are not just cars. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds—all play their part. But the worst wounds come from the biggest machines. A garbage truck killed a man at Central Park North, and a bus hit a pedestrian at Central Park West, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The stories repeat. The faces change.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p>The city has tools. The precinct has power. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people die. But too often, they wait for the next headline. After a cyclist was struck, a resident said, <em>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nina Schmidt</a>.</p><p>Local leaders have talked of Vision Zero. They have passed laws. But the streets tell a different story. Each crash is a policy failure. Each hit-and-run is a warning ignored.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This does not have to go on.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand real protection for people outside the car. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
