In Precinct 101, <strong>seven people have died</strong> on the roads since 2022. <strong>Five more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one person was killed and three were seriously hurt</strong>. <strong>208 others were injured</strong>—each one a life changed, a family shaken.

Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
