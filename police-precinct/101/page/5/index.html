The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. <strong>But in Precinct 101, the carnage continues.</strong> The police have the power to enforce speed limits, to ticket reckless drivers, to stand at the corners where people die. They have the power to act. <strong>Every day they wait, the toll grows.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 101 can do more.</strong> Speeding tickets. Failure-to-yield enforcement. Crackdowns at crash hotspots. <strong>Local leaders can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, and safer street design.</strong></p><p><strong>But nothing changes unless you demand it.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Contact your local council member, the mayor, and the precinct.
