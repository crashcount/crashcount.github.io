They have the power to act. <strong>Every day they wait, the toll grows.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 101 can do more.</strong> Speeding tickets. Failure-to-yield enforcement. Crackdowns at crash hotspots. <strong>Local leaders can push for lower speed limits, more cameras, and safer street design.</strong></p><p><strong>But nothing changes unless you demand it.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Contact your local council member, the mayor, and the precinct.

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.
