Yarimi, driving with a suspended license, allegedly 'sped through a steady red light' at 68 mph—well above the 25 mph limit—before striking the family as they crossed Ocean Parkway. The district attorney called it 'one of the worst' crashes he had seen, stating the defendant's 'unconscionably dangerous driving wiped out a family.' The crash also injured Saada's son and five Uber passengers. Yarimi faces multiple felony charges and up to 15 years in prison.
