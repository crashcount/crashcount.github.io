The city now has the power to drop speeds. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The math is brutal. The ask is simple: <strong>lower the default to 20 mph</strong> (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>A tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; 30+ tickets multiplies risk fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat offenders to use speed limiters (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Three corners. Two laws. One city.</p><p>Slow the cars. Stop the worst repeat offenders. Do it before the next body hits the asphalt.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact downed the pole, which triggered another crash on the opposite side of the expressway. As the article notes, 'A truck had downed a pole, triggering another crash on the opposite side of the expressway.' One person was injured and taken to Woodhull Hospital. The sequence of collisions highlights the dangers of high-speed, multi-lane expressways and the risks posed by large vehicles losing control.
