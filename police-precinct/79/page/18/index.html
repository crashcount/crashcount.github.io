She is pregnant. A driver floors the gas. The car drags her down the street. She dies at the hospital. Her name is Tiffany Cifuni. Her family calls the driver a &ldquo;coward&rdquo; and a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/us-news/driver-who-mowed-down-mom-to-be-on-way-home-from-beyonce-show-nabbed-in-nyc-officials/>according to the New York Post</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and five suffered serious injuries</strong> in Precinct 79. There were <strong>382 injuries</strong> and <strong>720 crashes</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are hit in the crosswalk, on the sidewalk, in the bike lane. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-the-lane>The Leaders and the Lane</h2><p>On Bedford Avenue, the city built a protected bike lane. It was supposed to keep people safe. Then came the pushback. The mayor listened to some voices and ripped out the lane. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>as reported by amNY</a>. The lawsuits came next. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t act now, people are going to die. New York City, we&rsquo;ll see you in court,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>said one lawyer</a>.</p><p>The city claims to care about safety. But when the pressure comes, the barriers come down. The paint returns. The danger stays.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-the-police>The Role of the Police</h2><p>Precinct 79 has the power to act. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They can make it clear: reckless driving is not welcome here. But they need to know it matters. They need to hear it from you.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone with power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safe streets. Demand that the next name is not someone you know.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
