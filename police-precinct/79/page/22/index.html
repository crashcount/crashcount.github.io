Same ending.</p><ul><li>A 79‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at New York Ave and Herkimer, was hit by a left‑turning SUV. She died of crush injuries. Police listed failure to yield and distraction as factors (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</li><li>A 68‑year‑old woman, crossing with the signal at Broadway and Flushing, was struck by an SUV going straight. She died of internal injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</li><li>On Myrtle and Walworth, a 37‑year‑old worker in the roadway was killed in a multi‑truck conflict. Four vehicles. One body. Apparent death at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</li></ul><p>The moped rider on Marcus Garvey at Decatur was ejected and died at 4:27 a.m. Three vehicles, one parked. The record shows “apparent death” and “ejected.” No comfort in the paperwork (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><p>“Criminal charges for him were still pending,” police said after a Brooklyn collision that killed a moped rider elsewhere in the borough. It does not help here, but it echoes the pattern (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>Bedford Avenue leads the harm list: 103 injuries and one death. Tompkins shows two separate tallies of dozens of injuries. Flushing Avenue has one death and 67 injuries. These are repeat scenes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data rollup</a>).</li><li>Pedestrians carry the weight here: 6 deaths, 339 injuries since 2022. Cyclists: 290 injuries. Trucks and buses are in the mix in 26 pedestrian injury cases; SUVs and cars are in 295 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>precinct stats</a>).</li></ul><p>Put daylight at the corners. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Harden the turns. Protect the bike lanes on Bedford and Flushing. Mark and enforce truck turns on Myrtle and Walworth. These are standard tools. Use them where the blood is.</p><p>Nights keep killing.</p><p>The clock tells a story. Injuries spike from late afternoon into the night. Deaths stack up at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m., 6 p.m., 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 6 a.m., and 11 p.m. The worst hours for injuries: 5 p.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m., 5 p.m., 7 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., 11 p.m. This is a daylong grind with a hard edge after dark (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>). Target the nights. Target the hotspots.</p><p>What the numbers won’t forget.</p><ul><li>Since 2022 in Precinct 79: <strong>9 deaths</strong>, 1,723 injuries. Pedestrians: 6 of those deaths. Serious injuries: 20. Heavy vehicles killed 2 pedestrians; SUVs killed 3 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>precinct stats</a>).</li><li>This year to date, crashes are up about 31% over last year’s pace. Injuries up about 45%. Serious injuries tripled. The trend is bad and fast (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>).</li></ul><p>Police voices, thin comfort.</p><p>“A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said of a hit‑and‑run at Broadway and Suydam, just outside the precinct line but in our lives all the same (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a>). “It was not immediately clear whether the man was walking in a crosswalk,” another report added. He was dead either way (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city now has the power to drop speeds. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The math is brutal. The ask is simple: <strong>lower the default to 20 mph</strong> (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>A tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; 30+ tickets multiplies risk fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat offenders to use speed limiters (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Three corners. Two laws. One city.</p><p>Slow the cars. Stop the worst repeat offenders. Do it before the next body hits the asphalt.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
