Nineteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, that’s the cost of traffic violence in Precinct 79. The wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, two more lives were lost. Over five hundred injured. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=broken-promises-broken-bodies>Broken Promises, Broken Bodies</h2><p>Last fall, a 37-year-old man was crushed and killed at Myrtle and Walworth. Weeks earlier, a 49-year-old man died crossing Bedford and Lafayette. The year before, a 79-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Herkimer and New York Avenue. She was hit by an SUV. She did everything right. She is still dead.

They can redesign streets. They can enforce the law. But too often, they wait. They talk of plans. They talk of balance. The bodies pile up.

We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>.</p><p>The police in Precinct 79 have the tools.

They just need to act.</p><h2 id=no-more-waiting>No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct.
