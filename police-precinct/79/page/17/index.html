The city now has the power to drop speeds. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The math is brutal. The ask is simple: <strong>lower the default to 20 mph</strong> (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>A tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; 30+ tickets multiplies risk fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat offenders to use speed limiters (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Three corners. Two laws. One city.</p><p>Slow the cars.
