Heavy vehicles killed 2 pedestrians; SUVs killed 3 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>precinct stats</a>).</li><li>This year to date, crashes are up about 31% over last year’s pace. Injuries up about 45%. Serious injuries tripled. The trend is bad and fast (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>).</li></ul><p>Police voices, thin comfort.</p><p>“A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said of a hit‑and‑run at Broadway and Suydam, just outside the precinct line but in our lives all the same (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a>). “It was not immediately clear whether the man was walking in a crosswalk,” another report added. He was dead either way (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city now has the power to drop speeds. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The math is brutal. The ask is simple: <strong>lower the default to 20 mph</strong> (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>A tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; 30+ tickets multiplies risk fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat offenders to use speed limiters (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Three corners. Two laws. One city.</p><p>Slow the cars. Stop the worst repeat offenders. Do it before the next body hits the asphalt.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
