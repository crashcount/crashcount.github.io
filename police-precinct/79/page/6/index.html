Seventeen more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, Precinct 79 has seen 2,926 crashes. The toll is not abstract. It is bodies on the street, families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months alone, one person was killed and seven suffered life-altering wounds. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The blood has not dried. On October 10, a 49-year-old man was killed at Bedford and Lafayette. Last November, a 79-year-old woman crossing with the signal was crushed by two SUVs at Herkimer and New York Avenue. She died at the intersection, her right of way ignored. The numbers keep coming, but the pain is always fresh.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, 270 came from cars and SUVs, 23 from trucks and buses, 13 from bikes, and 4 from mopeds.

The police can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. But the carnage continues. The silence is loud. Every day without action is another day of risk. As one neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>warned about speeding</a> after a deadly hit-and-run nearby, the message is clear. The response is not.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> The police in Precinct 79 can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Local politicians can push for safer street design and stronger laws. But nothing changes unless you demand it. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them you want enforcement, not excuses. Tell them you want to live.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.
