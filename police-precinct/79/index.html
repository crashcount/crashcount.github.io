It does not help here, but it echoes the pattern (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>Bedford Avenue leads the harm list: 103 injuries and one death. Tompkins shows two separate tallies of dozens of injuries. Flushing Avenue has one death and 67 injuries. These are repeat scenes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data rollup</a>).</li><li>Pedestrians carry the weight here: 6 deaths, 339 injuries since 2022. Cyclists: 290 injuries. Trucks and buses are in the mix in 26 pedestrian injury cases; SUVs and cars are in 295 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>precinct stats</a>).</li></ul><p>Put daylight at the corners.

Deaths stack up at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m., 6 p.m., 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 6 a.m., and 11 p.m. The worst hours for injuries: 5 p.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m., 5 p.m., 7 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., 11 p.m. This is a daylong grind with a hard edge after dark (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>). Target the nights. Target the hotspots.</p><p>What the numbers won’t forget.</p><ul><li>Since 2022 in Precinct 79: <strong>9 deaths</strong>, 1,723 injuries. Pedestrians: 6 of those deaths. Serious injuries: 20. Heavy vehicles killed 2 pedestrians; SUVs killed 3 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>precinct stats</a>).</li><li>This year to date, crashes are up about 31% over last year’s pace.

The trend is bad and fast (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>).</li></ul><p>Police voices, thin comfort.</p><p>“A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said of a hit‑and‑run at Broadway and Suydam, just outside the precinct line but in our lives all the same (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a>). “It was not immediately clear whether the man was walking in a crosswalk,” another report added. He was dead either way (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city now has the power to drop speeds. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The math is brutal. The ask is simple: <strong>lower the default to 20 mph</strong> (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>A tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; 30+ tickets multiplies risk fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat offenders to use speed limiters (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Three corners. Two laws. One city.</p><p>Slow the cars. Stop the worst repeat offenders. Do it before the next body hits the asphalt.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
