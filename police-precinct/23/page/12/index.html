A car does not stop. In Precinct 23, this is not rare. It is routine. Six people are dead. Fourteen more are left with serious injuries. In three and a half years, there have been 2,019 crashes. The numbers pile up, but the bodies do not move.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. An 86-year-old woman struck by a moped at East 104th and 3rd. A 59-year-old man killed by a bike at 106th and 1st. A child, not yet one, hit by a sedan on 3rd Avenue. The street does not care. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-police-precinct-power-and-inaction>The Police Precinct: Power and Inaction</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless drivers. They can stand at the corner and watch the light. But the crashes keep coming. &ldquo;A bicyclist has died after colliding with a pedestrian in Central Park on Wednesday, police said&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/cyclist-fell-hit-head-swerving-avoid-pedestrian-central-park-has-died/16785901/>reported ABC7</a>. The words are flat. The loss is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-laws-passed-action-delayed>Leadership: Laws Passed, Action Delayed</h3><p>Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set its own speed limits now. But the limit on most streets is still 25 mph. The city could lower it to 20 mph today. It has not. &ldquo;Officials say Nico-Garcia was on an e-bike and was not wearing a helmet at the time he was thrown. There is no requirement for bicyclists over 14 years old to wear a helmet.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/cyclist-fell-hit-head-swerving-avoid-pedestrian-central-park-has-died/16785901/>ABC7</a>. The law points at the victim, not the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p>Precinct 23 can do more. The city can do more. The dead cannot. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand lower limits. Demand tickets for drivers who fail to yield.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
