A car does not stop. In Precinct 23, this is not rare. It is routine. Six people are dead. Fourteen more are left with serious injuries. In three and a half years, there have been 2,019 crashes. The numbers pile up, but the bodies do not move.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. An 86-year-old woman struck by a moped at East 104th and 3rd.

A Tesla, traveling at high speed—witnesses estimated 'at least 120, 130 [mph]'—lost control near E. 70th St. The car struck a guardrail, overturned, and caught fire. Both occupants were ejected. The driver died at the scene; her passenger survived. Firefighters and a hazmat team responded to extinguish the burning lithium-ion battery. The crash shut down northbound lanes.
