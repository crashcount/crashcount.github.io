Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead include the old and the young, pedestrians and cyclists, riders and passengers. The wounds are not just numbers. They are crushed bones, broken heads, and families left with empty chairs.</p><p>Just last year, a 59-year-old man was killed at an intersection by a cyclist. A baby died on 3rd Avenue, struck by a sedan. An 86-year-old woman was killed crossing at East 104th by a moped. The details are spare, the pain is not. <strong>Every crash is a life changed or ended.</strong></p><h3 id=the-dangers-multiply-vehicles-speed-and-lax-enforcement>The Dangers Multiply: Vehicles, Speed, and Lax Enforcement</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm:</strong> 172 pedestrian injuries and deaths. <strong>Bikes and mopeds killed and maimed too:</strong> 1 death and 27 injuries from bikes, 1 death and 10 injuries from mopeds and motorcycles. Trucks and buses added another death and 10 injuries. The street is a gauntlet. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the highest price.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. But the danger remains. As one witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>described</a> after a city worker was slashed by a cyclist, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always something in this city. Bright and early, like 6-something in the morning. It&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Local leaders have the power to act. The city has started to lower speed limits and expand camera enforcement. But change comes slow. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Community boards have called for real solutions. As one board member <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>demanded</a>, <strong>&ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>The police in Precinct 23 can do more. They can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. They can protect the crosswalks and corners where people die. But they need to know the public is watching.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-protection>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Protection</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. <strong>Every crash is preventable.
