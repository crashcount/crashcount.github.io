Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man struck dead by a train at 125th Street. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/man-fatally-struck-on-subway-tracks-in-harlem/>&ldquo;The man was unconscious and unresponsive on the tracks when officers responded.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Only loss.</p><p>Just last month, a 51-year-old man was killed on East 105th. He was on foot, emerging from behind a parked truck. A car hit him. He died in the street. Another man, 60, was left bruised and limping. The road did not forgive.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks killed or injured 176 people. Motorcycles and mopeds, 39. Bikes, 28. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross. The violence is steady. It does not care about age or time of day.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h2><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, crack down on failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood pools most often. But the silence is thick. The numbers rise. The dead do not speak.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to act. They can demand lower speed limits. They can push for street redesigns. They can fight for enforcement that protects the walker, not the one behind the wheel. But too often, action waits for another body. As one official <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/man-fatally-struck-on-subway-tracks-in-harlem/>said after a crash</a>, &ldquo;There were no arrests in the incident, and it was unclear how the man fell onto the roadbed; police believe there was no criminality.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The precinct can act. The council can act. The state can act. But only if you make them. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
