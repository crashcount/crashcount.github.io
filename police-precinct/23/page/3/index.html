Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man struck dead by a train at 125th Street. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/man-fatally-struck-on-subway-tracks-in-harlem/>&ldquo;The man was unconscious and unresponsive on the tracks when officers responded.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Only loss.</p><p>Just last month, a 51-year-old man was killed on East 105th. He was on foot, emerging from behind a parked truck. A car hit him. He died in the street. Another man, 60, was left bruised and limping. The road did not forgive.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks killed or injured 176 people. Motorcycles and mopeds, 39. Bikes, 28. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross. The violence is steady. It does not care about age or time of day.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h2><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, crack down on failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood pools most often. But the silence is thick. The numbers rise. The dead do not speak.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to act. They can demand lower speed limits. They can push for street redesigns. They can fight for enforcement that protects the walker, not the one behind the wheel. But too often, action waits for another body. As one official <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/man-fatally-struck-on-subway-tracks-in-harlem/>said after a crash</a>, &ldquo;There were no arrests in the incident, and it was unclear how the man fell onto the roadbed; police believe there was no criminality.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The precinct can act. The council can act. The state can act. But only if you make them. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

In February 2024, journalist Fazil Khan died in a Harlem apartment fire started by a charging battery; 22 others were injured. The article notes, 'Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.' The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.'

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
