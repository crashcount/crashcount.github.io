One was 81. A 2023 Ford SUV hit and killed her off the corner on a Monday morning in 2024, the right‑front bumper taking her down <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to city crash records</a>. A year earlier, a 46‑year‑old man died on his bike at 1st Avenue and East 47th just before 1 a.m. He was ejected and died at the scene, the report listing distraction and alcohol as factors on the cyclist’s side; no other vehicle was recorded in the crash <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the same dataset</a>. The loss stands.</p><p>Since 2022, this precinct logged 2,289 crashes. <strong>Three people died. 1,397 were hurt</strong>. Eighteen were seriously injured. SUVs led pedestrian harm here, tied to two deaths and 92 struck walkers, with trucks and buses close behind in severity <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>per precinct totals</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks>Where the street breaks</h3><p>The pain clusters on the big corridors. First Avenue tops the list with one death and 54 injuries. Second Avenue adds 100‑plus more injuries across its entries. East 59th Street has two deaths on the roll <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>from the precinct hotspot list</a>. Afternoons cut deep: injuries peak from 2 p.m. through the rush, with spikes at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>by the hour</a>.</p><p>The records name causes. “Other” factors dominate the serious harm here, tied to three deaths and 513 injuries. Distraction shows up in 45 injuries. Failure to yield appears again and again. Unsafe speed is logged even when bodies do the talking: a 25‑year‑old cyclist suffered severe head cuts after hitting a parked USPS truck at 2nd Avenue in May; the form marks unsafe speed and distraction on the rider’s side <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the city file</a>. Trucks hurt walkers hard: 21 pedestrian cases, three serious <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle roll‑up</a>.</p><h3 id=this-year-is-worse>This year is worse</h3><p>Year to date, crashes climbed 30% over last year.

Older New Yorkers bear the weight: in the last 12 months, people 75 and up account for two of the deaths <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>age breakdown</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-uptown-blood-downtown>Promises uptown, blood downtown</h3><p>When two people were killed at Bowery and Canal by a driver charged after topping 100 mph, City Hall said it would <strong>“take immediate steps to fortify this intersection”</strong> and plan a broader redesign of Canal Street <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>the commissioner said</a>. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps,” he said.

The city talks redesigns on 14th Street too, with $3 million for planning and a nod to pedestrians <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>as reported</a>.

Albany passed Sammy’s Law. New York City can set safer limits. Advocates call for a citywide 20 mph default and speed‑limiters for repeat offenders; the call is here: <strong><a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></strong>. The program that watches speed near schools runs around the clock through 2030. The worst drivers do the worst harm; proposals would force them to cap their speed. The names in this precinct’s log argue the case.</p><p>Ben Furnas said it plain after the Chinatown crash: <strong>“Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block.”</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>.

The impact shattered her pelvis, causing fatal crush injuries. The report states the victim 'died on the pavement.' The SUV showed no damage. Critically, the police report notes the driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash. No license, no right to drive, yet the vehicle continued straight ahead, ending a life. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative centers the unlicensed driver as a key element. No mention is made of any victim behavior contributing to the crash.
