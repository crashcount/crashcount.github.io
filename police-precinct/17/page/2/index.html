One was 81. A 2023 Ford SUV hit and killed her off the corner on a Monday morning in 2024, the right‑front bumper taking her down <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to city crash records</a>. A year earlier, a 46‑year‑old man died on his bike at 1st Avenue and East 47th just before 1 a.m. He was ejected and died at the scene, the report listing distraction and alcohol as factors on the cyclist’s side; no other vehicle was recorded in the crash <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the same dataset</a>. The loss stands.</p><p>Since 2022, this precinct logged 2,289 crashes. <strong>Three people died. 1,397 were hurt</strong>. Eighteen were seriously injured. SUVs led pedestrian harm here, tied to two deaths and 92 struck walkers, with trucks and buses close behind in severity <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>per precinct totals</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks>Where the street breaks</h3><p>The pain clusters on the big corridors. First Avenue tops the list with one death and 54 injuries. Second Avenue adds 100‑plus more injuries across its entries. East 59th Street has two deaths on the roll <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>from the precinct hotspot list</a>. Afternoons cut deep: injuries peak from 2 p.m. through the rush, with spikes at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>by the hour</a>.</p><p>The records name causes. “Other” factors dominate the serious harm here, tied to three deaths and 513 injuries. Distraction shows up in 45 injuries. Failure to yield appears again and again. Unsafe speed is logged even when bodies do the talking: a 25‑year‑old cyclist suffered severe head cuts after hitting a parked USPS truck at 2nd Avenue in May; the form marks unsafe speed and distraction on the rider’s side <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the city file</a>. Trucks hurt walkers hard: 21 pedestrian cases, three serious <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle roll‑up</a>.</p><h3 id=this-year-is-worse>This year is worse</h3><p>Year to date, crashes climbed 30% over last year. Injuries rose a quarter. The precinct counts 475 crashes through late August, with 310 injured and four serious cases, compared with 364 crashes and 249 injured by this time last year <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>year‑to‑date stats</a>. Older New Yorkers bear the weight: in the last 12 months, people 75 and up account for two of the deaths <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>age breakdown</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-uptown-blood-downtown>Promises uptown, blood downtown</h3><p>When two people were killed at Bowery and Canal by a driver charged after topping 100 mph, City Hall said it would <strong>“take immediate steps to fortify this intersection”</strong> and plan a broader redesign of Canal Street <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>the commissioner said</a>. “As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps,” he said. An advocate warned, <strong>“the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly.”</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>same</a>. The city talks redesigns on 14th Street too, with $3 million for planning and a nod to pedestrians <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>as reported</a>. The bodies pile up elsewhere.</p><h3 id=what-would-help-here-now>What would help here, now</h3><ul><li>Harden the turns on 1st and 2nd Avenues. Install daylighting at corners like East 59th and East 34th. Protect crossings where trucks roll heavy.</li><li>Target trucks with enforcement at the worst hours. The city’s own roll‑up shows trucks and buses drive a large share of severe pedestrian injuries here <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>.</li><li>Work the repeat hotspots. First Avenue. Second Avenue. East 59th Street. Fix the geometry; don’t wait for meetings.</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-save-lives>Citywide tools that save lives</h3><p>Lower speed saves life. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. New York City can set safer limits. Advocates call for a citywide 20 mph default and speed‑limiters for repeat offenders; the call is here: <strong><a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></strong>. The program that watches speed near schools runs around the clock through 2030. The worst drivers do the worst harm; proposals would force them to cap their speed. The names in this precinct’s log argue the case.</p><p>Ben Furnas said it plain after the Chinatown crash: <strong>“Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block.”</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>. So is First Avenue. So is East 59th. The map keeps its own score.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He fell, struck his head on the curb, and was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital. The pedestrian sustained minor abrasions. ABC7 notes, 'Officials say Nico-Garcia was on an e-bike and was not wearing a helmet at the time he was thrown.' New York City does not require cyclists over 14 to wear helmets. In Central Park, pedestrians have the right of way at all times.
