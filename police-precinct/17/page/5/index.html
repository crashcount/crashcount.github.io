Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 394 people were hurt in 624 crashes. The dead include an 81-year-old woman, struck by an SUV on East 59th Street. She died on the pavement, her life ended by a driver who was unlicensed. No warning. No second chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>A cyclist, age 46, was killed at 1st Avenue and East 47th. He was thrown from his bike. The crash report lists “driver inattention” and “alcohol involvement.” The street was quiet. The loss was not.</p><h3 id=the-system-fights-the-wrong-enemy>The System Fights the Wrong Enemy</h3><p><strong>Police have the power to enforce the law. They know the hotspots. They can ticket speeders and drivers who fail to yield.</strong> But too often, the crackdown falls on the wrong people. Cyclists are ticketed for crossing with the walk signal, even though the law allows it. The city’s own law says bikes can go with the white pedestrian signal. Still, the tickets come. The summonses pile up. The lawsuits follow.</p><blockquote><p>“It’s ridiculous that cyclists are being ticketed for riding legally, safely, and defensively. This is especially disconcerting now that the city is regularly giving bike riders a criminal summons as opposed to a traffic ticket.” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/bicyclist-files-class-action-suit-against-nypd-over-red-light-summonses-AC4589266>said a cyclist in a class action lawsuit</a></p></blockquote><p>The NYPD’s practice is so widespread, it has become policy. The lawsuit calls it “knowing, purposeful, malicious, and outrageous.” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/us-news/cyclist-sues-nypd-alleging-cops-wrongfully-dole-out-red-light-tickets-malicious-and-outrageous/>according to the New York Post</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-or-action>Leadership: Words or Action?</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools. Sammy’s Law lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries.</strong> But action is slow. The law sits on the books. Cameras wait for reauthorization. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-protection-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Protection, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Contact your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand that Precinct 17 police enforce the laws that save lives, not punish the vulnerable.</strong> Tell them to lower the speed limit, protect speed cameras, and target reckless drivers—not cyclists and pedestrians. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative centers the unlicensed driver as a key element. No mention is made of any victim behavior contributing to the crash.
