The driver survived. The shooter fled but was arrested. Violence erupted over a $40 ride. Police acted fast. The street was left scarred.</p><p class=mb3>According to ABC7 (2025-07-15), a 27-year-old taxi driver, Alusine Barrie, was shot in the abdomen during a fare dispute on Nelson Avenue, Bronx. The shooter, Joseph Meeks, 76, tried four credit cards before the argument escalated. ABC7 reports, "Mr. Barrie asked him to get out of the car and pay him, instead of paying him he shot him in the stomach." Meeks, with about 60 prior arrests, was charged with attempted murder. The United Federation of Taxi Drivers urged the district attorney to deny bail. The incident highlights risks faced by drivers and exposes gaps in passenger screening and fare enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
