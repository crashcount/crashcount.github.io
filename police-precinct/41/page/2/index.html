Three more left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 447 hurt. The streets do not care about age. One dead was 21. Another, 56. Another, 61. Some were walking. Some were riding. Some were just in the wrong place when metal met flesh.</p><p>On Coster Street, a 61-year-old man died under the wheels of a box truck. He was sleeping beneath it. The driver did not see him. &ldquo;Nobody checks under their car to see if someone is there,&rdquo; a local worker <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/17/man-sleeping-under-box-truck-crushed-dead-hunts-point-bronx/>said</a>. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s common for Hunts Point.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed three, trucks killed one. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill here. The violence is heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-silence>Leadership: Action or Silence?</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> Speed cameras slash speeding by more than half. But laws mean nothing if leaders do not act. In Precinct 41, the silence is thick. No bold new enforcement. No public push for safer crossings. No crackdown on reckless drivers. The police have the power to ticket speeders, to target hotspots, to protect the people who walk and ride. They just need to use it.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-the-precinct>The Role of the Precinct</h3><p><strong>Precinct 41 can make a difference.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at corners where the blood dries fastest. They can show the city that these deaths are not just numbers. They are neighbors, gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family risks losing someone. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand lower speeds, more enforcement, and real protection for the people who walk these streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
