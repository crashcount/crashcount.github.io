The crash record points there.</p><h3 id=the-policies-that-match-the-harm>The policies that match the harm</h3><p>Citywide, the fixes exist. Lower the default speed limit under Sammy’s Law and slow residential streets to 20 MPH. Pass the Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) to require speed limiters for repeat camera offenders.
