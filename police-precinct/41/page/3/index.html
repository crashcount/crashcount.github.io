A driver runs a red light. The car jumps the curb. Three men on the sidewalk are hit. One is left fighting for his life. The driver runs, but police catch him. The charges are long: vehicular assault, fleeing police, reckless endangerment, driving without a license. Police say he &ldquo;slammed on the gas and sped off east on Hunts Point Ave., blowing through a red light&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). Five people go to the hospital. The street is stained again (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-hunts-point-pedestrians-struck/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Just days before, seven more are hurt on the Hutchinson Parkway. A scooter is struck. An 18-year-old woman is thrown from the seat. She lands hard. She is critical (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/hutchinson-river-parkway-accident-bronx-involving-moped-driver-injures-7/16808062/>ABC7</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last year, Precinct 41 saw 674 crashes, 440 injuries, and 3 deaths.</strong> Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p>Police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can stand at the corners where blood pools and say, Not here, not today. But the carnage continues. The silence is loud.</p><p>&ldquo;All three pedestrians were taken to a local hospital. One of them, a 33-year-old man, was critically injured, police say&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-hunts-point-pedestrians-struck/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Local leaders can act. They can demand more enforcement. They can push for safer street design. They can speak up when the city drags its feet. Or they can do nothing and let the numbers rise.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Most injuries to pedestrians here come from cars and trucks.</strong> In three years: 3 deaths, 19 serious injuries, 1,451 hurt. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars the rest of us do not see.</p><p><strong>Precinct 41 can do more.</strong> So can City Hall. So can Albany. But nothing changes until the people demand it.</p><hr><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Contact your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement, failure-to-yield tickets, and real protection for those on foot and on bikes.</strong> Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
