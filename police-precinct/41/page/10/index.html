Since 2022, <strong>10 people have died</strong> and <strong>1,517 have been injured</strong> in crashes. <strong>Twenty-one</strong> of those injuries were serious. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last year alone, three more lives ended. Four hundred ninety people were hurt.</p><p>Just days ago, a driver in a Mustang failed a left turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the sidewalk and struck six people. He ran. The victims went to Lincoln Hospital. All survived, but the street kept their blood. Police are still searching for the driver. The Daily News <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>reported the search for the man who rammed into six people after botching a turn</a>.</p><p>A week before, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. His 71-year-old passenger died. Seven others were hurt. A witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>described the scene: &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-role-of-the-precinct>The Role of the Precinct</h3><p><strong>Precinct 41 has the power to act.</strong> Police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people die. They can make the street remember something else.</p><p>But the numbers say the work is not done. Cars and trucks are the main killers. SUVs, sedans, and trucks together caused most deaths and injuries. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The street does not care who had the light. Only who walks away.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. The city can now lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders. But the pace is slow. Each delay is a risk. Each day without action is another family waiting for a call from the hospital.</p><p><strong>Residents must demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them the street is not safe. Tell them to lower the speed limit, fix the crossings, and keep the cameras rolling. Tell them to make Precinct 41 a place where people walk home alive.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
