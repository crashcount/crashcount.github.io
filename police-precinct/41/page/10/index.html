The record here shows danger on Bruckner, Westchester, Southern, and Hunts Point Ave. The precinct can target these corridors. The city can harden turns, add daylighting and LPIs, and slow the right‑turns that crush people at corners. Trucks need tighter routing and enforcement where they mix with crosswalks.</p><p>Citywide fixes are on the table now. A lower default speed and a crackdown on repeat speeders are laid out on our action page. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the worst offenders to obey the limit.
