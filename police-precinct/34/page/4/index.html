But the numbers keep climbing.</p><p>Just this week, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit the woman, and ran. The officers checked the victim, then left.

The dead do not get second chances.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed two people and injured over 200 more. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. Trucks and buses added to the toll. The victims are young and old: children, seniors, workers, mothers.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But too often, the response is a shrug.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> The city can lower speed limits.
