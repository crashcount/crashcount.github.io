Ten were seriously injured.</strong> Not one person should have to bleed in the crosswalk or on a bike. But the numbers keep climbing.</p><p>Just this week, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit the woman, and ran. The officers checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>pleaded, &ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>This is not a fluke.</strong> Last year, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st. A 15-year-old died on a moped at Saint Nicholas Avenue. A woman lost her life as a passenger when a driver blew through a traffic control. The dead do not get second chances.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed two people and injured over 200 more. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. Trucks and buses added to the toll. The victims are young and old: children, seniors, workers, mothers.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But too often, the response is a shrug.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. The precinct can crack down on repeat offenders. But change comes slow. The silence is louder than the sirens.</p><p><strong>Residents are not waiting.</strong> They demand speed humps. They demand enforcement. They demand to live.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>If you live here, speak up.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safer crossings. Demand action before the next siren is for someone you love.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 58-year-old female driver, licensed in New York, was cited for 'Following Too Closely,' which led her sedan to collide with the rear of another sedan traveling northbound. The impact caused injuries to both vehicle occupants: a 23-year-old male front passenger sustained head injuries, and the driver suffered back injuries. Both victims were not ejected but experienced shock. The report highlights the driver error of failing to maintain a safe following distance as the primary contributing factor.

According to the police report, both vehicles were 'making right turn' when they crashed. The report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Turning Improperly' as contributing factors. The narrative describes the scene: 'Steel kissed steel. The Honda's side split. The BMW's nose crushed. Two young men, both 22, slumped inside, heads bleeding. Semiconscious. Silent. The speed still echoed in the wreckage.' The data shows both drivers were licensed and neither occupant was ejected.

The e-scooter driver, who was unlicensed, sustained abrasions to his elbow and lower arm and remained conscious after the collision. The report cites two primary driver errors: unsafe speed by the e-scooter operator and pedestrian/bicyclist confusion contributing to the crash. The sedan driver was licensed and operating a 2021 Toyota sedan. The point of impact on the sedan was the left front bumper. The collision underscores the dangers posed by unlicensed operation and unsafe speed, compounded by confusion in vulnerable road user behavior, without assigning fault to the injured e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
