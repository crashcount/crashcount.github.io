Twenty-three seriously injured.</strong> In the last three and a half years, Precinct 34 has seen 2,137 crashes. The wounded are not numbers—they are neighbors, children, cyclists, workers. One was a 37-year-old man on a bike, thrown from his seat and killed on West 181st Street. Another was a 15-year-old, crushed on a moped at West 185th. A 21-year-old woman died in a burning car after a crash on 10th Avenue. The street does not forgive. It does not care if you are young or old, walking or riding. It only takes.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage.</strong> Two killed, six left with serious injuries, 68 more with wounds that do not heal fast. Bikes, mopeds, and trucks add to the toll. The blood dries, but the pain stays.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. But action is rare. When a police chase ends in fire and death, the silence is louder than the sirens. The NYPD Commissioner <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/03/us-news/2-nypd-cops-drive-off-after-bronx-to-manhattan-chase-of-stolen-car-car-ends-in-deadly-crash-sources/>stated</a>, &ldquo;The NYPD&rsquo;s enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk, and pursuits for violations and low-level crimes can be both potentially dangerous and unnecessary.&rdquo; But the dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>After a fatal crash, the officers left. They did not call for help. They did not report the wreck. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/03/nypd-cops-suspended-for-fleeing-fiery-fatal-manhattan-crash-after-chasing-driver-sources/>The officers are accused of fleeing, leaving him to die in the fiery wreck.</a> The investigation drags on. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Comes Next: The Cost of Waiting</h3><p><strong>Precinct 34 can do more.</strong> Every ticket for speeding, every crackdown on reckless turns, every patrol at a crash hotspot is a life not lost. But it takes pressure. It takes calls, emails, and voices that do not let up. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The precinct has the power to enforce them. The only thing missing is the will.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
