The law now lets New York set its own speed limits. But the work is not done. <strong>&ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a></p><p>Yet, too often, the burden falls on the vulnerable.
