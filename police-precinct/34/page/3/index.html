The police came. They left. The fire kept burning. His family watched the video later. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for.

They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood pools and glass scatters. But too often, the law is silent. After Guzman Parra’s death, the officers were suspended. The department said it would investigate. &ldquo;In that one moment where they effectively weighed their careers to be more important than Francisco&rsquo;s life, they played the role of judge, jury and executioner,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said the family’s attorney</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They talk of safer streets. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The precinct can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. The time for talk is over. Every day of delay is another day of risk for the people who walk, bike, or wait for a bus.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Demand action. Demand enforcement. Demand that every crash is treated as a crime scene, not a routine. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. It is time to choose life. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, both vehicles were 'making right turn' when they crashed. The report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Turning Improperly' as contributing factors. The narrative describes the scene: 'Steel kissed steel. The Honda's side split. The BMW's nose crushed. Two young men, both 22, slumped inside, heads bleeding. Semiconscious. Silent. The speed still echoed in the wreckage.' The data shows both drivers were licensed and neither occupant was ejected. The focus remains on driver actions—unsafe speed and improper turning—as the root causes of this violent crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The e-scooter driver, who was unlicensed, sustained abrasions to his elbow and lower arm and remained conscious after the collision. The report cites two primary driver errors: unsafe speed by the e-scooter operator and pedestrian/bicyclist confusion contributing to the crash. The sedan driver was licensed and operating a 2021 Toyota sedan. The point of impact on the sedan was the left front bumper. The collision underscores the dangers posed by unlicensed operation and unsafe speed, compounded by confusion in vulnerable road user behavior, without assigning fault to the injured e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
