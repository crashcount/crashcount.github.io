The police came. They left. The fire kept burning. His family watched the video later. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for.

They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood pools and glass scatters. But too often, the law is silent. After Guzman Parra’s death, the officers were suspended. The department said it would investigate. &ldquo;In that one moment where they effectively weighed their careers to be more important than Francisco&rsquo;s life, they played the role of judge, jury and executioner,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said the family’s attorney</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They talk of safer streets. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The precinct can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. The time for talk is over. Every day of delay is another day of risk for the people who walk, bike, or wait for a bus.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Demand action. Demand enforcement. Demand that every crash is treated as a crime scene, not a routine. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. It is time to choose life. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
