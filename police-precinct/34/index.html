But the numbers keep climbing.</p><p>Just this week, a cyclist was struck at West 181st and Cabrini. The driver made a U-turn, hit the woman, and ran. The officers checked the victim, then left. The car was abandoned. The driver vanished. A neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>pleaded, &ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>This is not a fluke.</strong> Last year, a 37-year-old cyclist was killed on West 181st. A 15-year-old died on a moped at Saint Nicholas Avenue. A woman lost her life as a passenger when a driver blew through a traffic control. The dead do not get second chances.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed two people and injured over 200 more. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. Trucks and buses added to the toll. The victims are young and old: children, seniors, workers, mothers.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But too often, the response is a shrug.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. The precinct can crack down on repeat offenders. But change comes slow. The silence is louder than the sirens.</p><p><strong>Residents are not waiting.</strong> They demand speed humps. They demand enforcement. They demand to live.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>If you live here, speak up.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct.

The rider was injured, partially ejected, and suffered a leg injury; he wore a helmet. Sedan occupants had unspecified injuries. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” That driver error set the stage for impact. The sedan showed damage to the left rear bumper; the motorcycle’s front end took the hit. No other factors were listed beyond inattention. Helmet use is noted for the motorcyclist, but it comes after the cited driver inattention in the record.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The driver, Autumn Donna Ascencio Romero, had faced charges for a previous crash but was released without bail. The article reports, 'Romero was behind the wheel of a booze- and drug-filled stolen blue Chevy Malibu when it plowed into a man on a bicycle and a 63-year-old woman on a bench.' Police said the car was packed with pills, marijuana, and alcohol. Romero and her passenger fled but were quickly caught.

The article notes, 'Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene.' Enforcement of bike regulations in Central Park is rare, despite ongoing crackdowns elsewhere. The Department of Transportation relies on NYPD data, but underreporting skews injury statistics.
