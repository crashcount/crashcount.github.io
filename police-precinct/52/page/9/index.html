In the last year alone, 2 people died and 5 suffered life-changing wounds. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm, with 1 death and 9 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2. Bikes and mopeds left others broken.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-pain-on-the-pavement>Recent Crashes: Pain on the Pavement</h3><p>On July 3, a Ford Mustang mounted the curb at East 149th and Courtlandt. Six people were struck. The driver fled. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The victims ranged from 30 to 79. All went to the hospital. The car was left behind, battered and stripped of plates. The street was left with blood and fear.</p><p>A week later, a truck overturned and spilled liquid asphalt across a Bronx road. No one died, but the street turned hazardous in an instant. The cleanup dragged on. The <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/truck-overturns-spills-liquid-asphalt-on-bronx-road/>risk remains</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras now run 24/7. The law allows lower speed limits. But change is slow. The police can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless turns, and target hotspots. They can act now. But too often, the response comes after the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The numbers are not fate. They are a call to act. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The panic will not end until the killing stops.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.
