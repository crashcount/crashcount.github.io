Courtlandt Avenue and East 149th Street.</strong> A Ford Mustang turned, hit a woman in the crosswalk, then mounted the curb and plowed into five more people under the scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The car, front smashed, plates gone, left behind. Six neighbors went to the hospital. One witness <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting.&rdquo; Another <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said</a>, &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months, Precinct 52 saw <strong>2 deaths, 5 serious injuries, and 665 people hurt</strong> in 1,003 crashes.

Crackdowns on reckless driving. The power to target crash hotspots. The power to make drivers slow down, or pay. But the danger remains. In the last year, cars and SUVs caused the most harm: <strong>1 death, 9 serious injuries, 293 other injuries</strong> to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed two more. Bikes and mopeds, far less. The threat is heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p><strong>City leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They pass laws. They promise action. But the blood on the sidewalk says not enough has changed. The city has new speed limits and more cameras. But the crashes keep coming. The Mustang driver ran. The people on the ground could not. The silence from leaders is loud. The police can act. The council can act. The mayor can act. But only if you force them.</p><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors. They are you.</p><hr><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more from Precinct 52. Demand more from your council member, your assembly member, your mayor. Call for speed enforcement. Call for real protection at every crosswalk. Call until the killing stops.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
