Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders, Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, were thrown and died at the hospital, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, Gothamist reported.</p><p>“Two people were killed. He was drunk,” the victim’s sister said outside court, quoted by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a>. “How could they let him go?” their mother asked, the Daily News reported.

From midnight to 5 a.m., seven people were killed and hundreds injured, with spikes at midnight and 5 a.m., per city data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronx River Parkway</a> is a top hotspot here, with two deaths and more than a hundred injuries. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Major Deegan</a> follows.</p><p>The bodies tell the story: pedestrians, cyclists, riders, passengers. In this precinct since 2022, pedestrians suffered 371 injuries and three deaths; cyclists 115 injuries; riders of other small motorized devices 59 injuries; vehicle occupants eight deaths and 1,525 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Heavy vehicles are not the bulk; cars and SUVs drive most pedestrian injuries here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-keeps-breaking-here>What keeps breaking here</h3><p>“Other” is the leading listed factor in the precinct’s injury and death toll, with five deaths tied to it. Vulnerable road user error appears in the data too, but the worst damage tracks the hours, the speed, and the corridors (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Unsafe speed shows up in the ledger. Failure to yield maims people on side streets. Distraction is there as well.</p><p>On West Kingsbridge and University, a 65‑year‑old crossing with the signal was hit and killed by a turning van, police records say (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4801942</a>). On Mosholu at Bainbridge, a moped rider died after a collision with a BMW sedan (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4692380</a>). The dates change. The pattern does not.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-tame-the-nights>Fix the corners. Tame the nights.</h3><p>Start with the hotspots. Daylight crossings and harden turns on West Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue. Give leading pedestrian intervals at University and Kingsbridge. Clamp down on night speeding on the Bronx River Parkway and the Major Deegan with targeted operations tied to the midnight–5 a.m. window the data flags, and repeat them at the same places each week (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>These are simple moves. They protect people outside the car first.</p><h3 id=citywide-levers-that-save-lives-here>Citywide levers that save lives here</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. New York has the power to set safer limits. Advocates urge the city to drop the default to 20 mph. You can press your officials now (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>The worst repeat speeders do outsized harm. The proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would force drivers with extreme ticket histories or points to use tech that caps speed. Safe‑streets groups are calling lawmakers to move it.
