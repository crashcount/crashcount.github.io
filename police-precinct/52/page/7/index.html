Twenty-seven were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. In the last twelve months alone, two lives were lost and 661 people were hurt. The numbers do not flinch.</p><p>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman was killed when a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole. Seven others were injured. &ldquo;A 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars in the Bronx before hitting a light pole, killing his passenger and injuring himself and six others, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>NY Daily News</a>).

People over 65 were hit 41 times; two did not survive. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, vans, and even an ambulance took lives. A van killed a 65-year-old man in a crosswalk. A moped crash killed a 15-year-old girl. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras are renewed. But the work is not finished. Police in Precinct 52 can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can act now. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real enforcement.

A moped, operated by an unlicensed and helmetless 41-year-old man, overturned and left its rider ejected and crushed, suffering injuries to his entire body but remaining conscious in the aftermath. The report states that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor. One sedan, an Audi driven by an unlicensed man, was engaged in a police pursuit and fled the scene. The violence of the crash is underscored by the report’s vivid description: 'Metal screamed. Glass rained.' The moped’s lack of safety equipment is noted in the data, but the central danger stemmed from driver actions—specifically, unsafe speed and a police pursuit. No evidence in the report attributes fault to the moped rider’s behavior beyond these systemic and driver errors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
