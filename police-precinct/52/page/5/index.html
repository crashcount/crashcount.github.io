The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronx River Parkway</a> is a top hotspot here, with two deaths and more than a hundred injuries.

The report states the driver was inattentive or distracted, listing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The cyclist, a 41-year-old man, was ejected from his bike and suffered severe facial lacerations. He remained conscious at the scene. The narrative describes the impact: 'Metal struck flesh. He flew, helmetless. His face hit pavement. Blood pooled.' The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the danger posed by inattentive drivers making turns across the paths of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
