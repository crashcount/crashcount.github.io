Nearly two thousand injured.</strong> In just over three years, the streets of Precinct 52 have become a gauntlet. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, two people lost their lives. <strong>Five more were left with wounds that will not heal.</strong></p><p>Last week, a 71-year-old woman died after a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole. Seven others were hurt. The street was closed, the air thick with sirens. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said a witness</a>. The cause is still under investigation. No arrests. No answers. Only loss.</p><p>A few days before, a truck overturned and spilled liquid asphalt across the road. No one died, but the street was left slick and dangerous. The city swept it up. The risk remains. &ldquo;Liquid asphalt poured onto a road in the Bronx after a truck overturned Wednesday,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/truck-overturns-spills-liquid-asphalt-on-bronx-road/>reported CBS</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and passengers take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons: 303 crashes, 1 death, 9 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, fourteen crashes, no deaths this year—but the scars run deep. Bikes, nine crashes, no deaths. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>The city has new tools. Lower speed limits. More speed cameras. The law is there. But the blood keeps coming. The police in Precinct 52 can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people die. They have the power. They need to use it.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for safer street design, for real enforcement, for action—not words. But every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at crash hotspots. Demand that every life counts. The dead cannot speak.
