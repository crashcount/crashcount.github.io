In the last year alone, 2 people died and 5 suffered life-changing wounds. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm, with 1 death and 9 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2. Bikes and mopeds left others broken.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-pain-on-the-pavement>Recent Crashes: Pain on the Pavement</h3><p>On July 3, a Ford Mustang mounted the curb at East 149th and Courtlandt. Six people were struck. The driver fled. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The victims ranged from 30 to 79. All went to the hospital. The car was left behind, battered and stripped of plates. The street was left with blood and fear.</p><p>A week later, a truck overturned and spilled liquid asphalt across a Bronx road. No one died, but the street turned hazardous in an instant. The cleanup dragged on. The <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/truck-overturns-spills-liquid-asphalt-on-bronx-road/>risk remains</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras now run 24/7. The law allows lower speed limits. But change is slow. The police can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless turns, and target hotspots. They can act now. But too often, the response comes after the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The numbers are not fate. They are a call to act. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The panic will not end until the killing stops.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.

The point of impact was the center front end of the e-bike. The pedestrian sustained injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot, including contusions and bruises, and was conscious at the scene. The report does not list any contributing factors related to driver errors or pedestrian behaviors. The absence of driver fault citations in the report leaves the circumstances of the collision unclear, but the pedestrian was injured while crossing in a non-designated area.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
