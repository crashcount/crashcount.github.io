Twenty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, 1,828 people have been injured in crashes. The dead include a 15-year-old girl ejected from a moped, a 65-year-old man crossing with the light, and a driver stranded on the Deegan, waiting for help that never came. Each number is a life cut short. Each injury, a family changed forever.</p><p>On March 22, 2025, a Mercedes slammed into a disabled Ford on the Major Deegan Expressway. The driver of the Mercedes ran. The man he left behind, Darryl Mathis, died at St. Barnabas Hospital. Police said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>they were looking for a man who ran away after crashing his car.</a> His friends arrived too late. &ldquo;He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run. They were on their way to come give him a jump and he got hit waiting for them. And then he called to let them know, I&rsquo;ve been hit. I can&rsquo;t breathe,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>said Cornelius &lsquo;Big Grim&rsquo; Whitaker</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they left bodies in the street. In the last year, two more died. Six were seriously hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But they must act.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>City Hall says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The NYPD promises &ldquo;to take appropriate enforcement action.&rdquo; But the dead keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The precinct can crack down on reckless driving. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand action. Tell the 52nd Precinct to enforce the law. <strong>Do not wait for another family to get the call.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
