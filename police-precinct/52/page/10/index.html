Twenty-seven suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include children, elders, and those just trying to cross the street. A 65-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal, crushed by a van making a right turn. A 15-year-old girl, ejected from a moped, died on University Avenue. The list goes on. The sidewalk is not a safe place. The crosswalk is not a safe place. The numbers do not care if you are careful.</p><p>Just last week, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn and <strong>&ldquo;rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>according to NY Daily News</a>. The driver fled. The victims went to Lincoln Hospital. They survived. This time.</p><p>Days before, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. His 71-year-old passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died. <strong>&ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>a witness told ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>The city has new tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York set its own speed limits. The city can drop the default to 20 mph. It has not. Speed cameras are renewed, but the carnage continues. Local leaders have the power to act. They can demand enforcement, redesign streets, and end the reign of reckless drivers. They can push for the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, which would sideline the worst repeat offenders. Some have spoken. Most have not. The silence is loud.</p><p>The police in Precinct 52 hold the keys. They can enforce speed limits, ticket drivers who fail to yield, and target crash hotspots. They can act before the next siren. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the pavement.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where children can cross and live. The blood on the road is not an act of God. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
