Twenty-seven were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. In the last twelve months alone, two lives were lost and 661 people were hurt. The numbers do not flinch.</p><p>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman was killed when a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole. Seven others were injured. &ldquo;A 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars in the Bronx before hitting a light pole, killing his passenger and injuring himself and six others, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>NY Daily News</a>).

People over 65 were hit 41 times; two did not survive. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, vans, and even an ambulance took lives. A van killed a 65-year-old man in a crosswalk. A moped crash killed a 15-year-old girl. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras are renewed. But the work is not finished. Police in Precinct 52 can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can act now. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit.

The report states, 'Traffic signal ignored.' The moped lay twisted in the dark, its rider showing no pulse. The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting the BMW driver's failure to obey a traffic signal. The moped rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the police report, but these details are mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard traffic controls, with the vulnerable moped rider bearing the brunt of systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
