An 82-year-old, struck by a motorcycle on 60th. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, killed by a left-turning sedan at 7th Avenue and 44th.

The pain is sharper.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed most.</strong> In three years, 13 people have died here. Twenty more have been seriously hurt. Trucks, sedans, motorcycles, mopeds—they all leave bodies behind. The street does not care if you are young or old. The street does not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about safety.</strong> They pass laws. They hold press conferences. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph</strong>. Cameras catch speeders. The police can ticket reckless drivers, target crash hotspots, and enforce the law. But action is slow. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><p>A mother, a father, a neighbor—gone.

The follow-through is not.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-the-precinct>The Role of the Precinct</h3><p><strong>Precinct 72 holds the line.</strong> Officers can crack down on speeding. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at the corners where people die and make it stop. They know the hotspots. They know the names. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement.

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Plaintiffs argue the city violated Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires advance notice and community input before removing bike lanes. The Department of Transportation skipped this step, announcing the removal on social media after consulting only select community members. The article quotes the lawsuit: the city acted "improperly, irrationally, without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion." Data cited in the suit show the upgraded lane improved safety for all road users. Councilman Lincoln Restler supported the legal action, seeking a restraining order to keep the lane. The case highlights failures in city process and the risks posed when safe infrastructure is abruptly erased.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
