It did not stop. It hit Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, as they crossed the street. The car sent their bodies flying. The driver ran. Police found him later and charged him with manslaughter and leaving the scene. The men were walking to a food pantry.

Six were seriously hurt. Since 2022, the toll is <strong>13 dead, 2,253 injured, 21 seriously hurt</strong>. Most victims are people on foot or bike. Cars and trucks did the most harm, killing 3 and injuring 209. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1, injured 14. Bikes injured 32. The bodies pile up. The story does not change.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>The city has tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set lower speed limits. The NYPD can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. But on Third Avenue, the city paused a safety plan after business pushback. The deaths followed. Community Board 7 supported the redesign. City Hall stalled. The police can target crash hotspots. They can write tickets. They can save lives. They need to act.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the Third Avenue redesign. Demand real enforcement against speeding and reckless driving. Tell Precinct 72 to protect the people who walk and bike. Do not wait for the next body in the crosswalk.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police say Yarimi was "probably doing close to twice the speed limit" and "ran a red light" before hitting an Uber and then a family crossing the street. Three pedestrians—Natasha Saada, 34, and her daughters, ages 8 and 5—were killed. A 4-year-old remains hospitalized. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called the driving "almost being wanton." Yarimi’s car had multiple prior tickets from red light and speed cameras. The crash highlights ongoing policy concerns about repeat traffic offenders and street safety. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the city "is still working to make streets safer, emphasizing the need to protect vulnerable New Yorkers."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An e-bike delivery worker flew through a stop sign. The crash was sudden. Cruz died on the street. The rider stayed. The intersection is known for danger. Delivery speed and city policy collide.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on March 23, 2025, that Luis Cruz, 49, died after being struck by an e-bike delivery worker who "sped through a stop sign" at Franklin and India streets in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene; no arrests were made as the investigation continued. The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves. City data shows e-bikes account for a small share of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
