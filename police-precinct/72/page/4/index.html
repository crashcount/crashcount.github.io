Police say the driver, Menachem Shagalow, was unlicensed and charged with aggravated unlicensed operation, failure to exercise due care, and unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Brod died from her injuries at Maimonides Medical Center on April 20. The article notes, 'Menachem was arrested at 8:37 p.m. on April 8 shortly after the incident.' This crash follows another fatal collision involving a suspended driver in Brooklyn the previous week.

Epps, unlicensed, "blew a stop sign" and struck a school bus, killing his passenger, Imani Vance, and injuring the bus driver. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant's reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds." Epps left the scene, tried to escape in an Uber, and was arrested after fleeing on foot. The crash was one of three fatal Brooklyn incidents that weekend. City data cited in the article shows ongoing danger: at least 15 killed in Kings County so far this year, with thousands injured, often due to driver inattention and failure to yield.

Andrew Gounardes said the driver 'clearly would've met the threshold.' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crash 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.'
