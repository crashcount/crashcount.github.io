Two men stepped into the crosswalk at 3rd Avenue and 52nd Street. A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, died where they fell. The driver kept going. Police found him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault.
