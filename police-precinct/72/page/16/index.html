They had the light. The BMW driver ran the red and kept going. Both men died at the scene. The street was busy. The city was silent. CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>reported</a> that since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people</strong> on this two-mile stretch.

Twenty-one suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Most were walking or biking. Most did nothing wrong. The numbers do not lie. The city has known about Third Avenue for years. Plans to fix it have sat on a shelf since 2014. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025.
