An 82-year-old, struck by a motorcycle on 60th. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, killed by a left-turning sedan at 7th Avenue and 44th.

The pain is sharper.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed most.</strong> In three years, 13 people have died here. Twenty more have been seriously hurt. Trucks, sedans, motorcycles, mopeds—they all leave bodies behind. The street does not care if you are young or old. The street does not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk about safety.</strong> They pass laws. They hold press conferences. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph</strong>. Cameras catch speeders. The police can ticket reckless drivers, target crash hotspots, and enforce the law. But action is slow. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><p>A mother, a father, a neighbor—gone.

The follow-through is not.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-the-precinct>The Role of the Precinct</h3><p><strong>Precinct 72 holds the line.</strong> Officers can crack down on speeding. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at the corners where people die and make it stop. They know the hotspots. They know the names. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement.
