A woman, 66, thrown from her moped on 39th. An 82-year-old, dead on 5th Avenue. In the last twelve months, Precinct 72 saw 2 deaths and 5 serious injuries from traffic violence. 663 people were hurt.

In three and a half years, they killed at least 7 people and left hundreds more injured. Trucks, sedans, SUVs, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all left blood on the street. SUVs and sedans alone caused 3 deaths and 50 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed at least 1. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1. Bikes left 5 with moderate injuries. No one is safe. Not the old, not the young. Not the ones crossing with the light, not the ones on the sidewalk.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can act. But the limit is not yet 20 mph. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The law that keeps them running is up for renewal again. Every delay is a risk. Every day without action is another chance for a family to lose someone. Local leaders talk of Vision Zero, but the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-72>The Role of Precinct 72</h3><p>Police can enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can make it clear that failure to yield is not just a mistake—it’s a crime. They have the tools. They need to use them.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the DOT. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand enforcement.
