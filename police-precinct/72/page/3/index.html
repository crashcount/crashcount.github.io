The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year.

Police identified a stolen Porsche, attempted a traffic stop, and set up a roadblock after the car evaded officers. According to the article, "Police say that officer fired one shot, striking the driver." The driver then crashed into an NYPD vehicle and later died at the hospital. A passenger was taken into custody. The incident drew a large police response, with one witness describing, "30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that's insane." The report highlights high-speed movement, a roadblock, and the use of deadly force. No officers were struck, but the event underscores risks in police pursuits and the dangers posed by fleeing vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police say Brod had the light. The driver, Menachem Shagalow, 65, was unlicensed and charged with aggravated unlicensed operation and failure to exercise due care. The article quotes Brod's grandson: "She was extremely independent till her last day." Brod died less than two weeks after the crash. The incident highlights ongoing risks for pedestrians, especially from unlicensed drivers. Shagalow was released with a desk appearance ticket. The case underscores persistent gaps in enforcement and street design that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
