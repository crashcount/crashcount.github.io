They had the light. The BMW driver ran the red and kept going. Both men died at the scene. The street was busy. The city was silent. CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>reported</a> that since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people</strong> on this two-mile stretch. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-broken-promises-endless-waiting>The Pattern: Broken Promises, Endless Waiting</h3><p><strong>Fourteen people have died in Precinct 72 since 2022.</strong> Over 2,300 have been injured. Twenty-one suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Most were walking or biking. Most did nothing wrong. The numbers do not lie. The city has known about Third Avenue for years. Plans to fix it have sat on a shelf since 2014. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo; There is no answer. There is only waiting.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-words-not-action>The Leaders: Words, Not Action</h3><p>After the latest deaths, officials gathered. They spoke of safety. They spoke of families. Councilmember Alexa Avilés <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>called</a> for real investment: &ldquo;We want the city to actually commit real capital to make sure that it can do treatments that truly address the safety concerns while balancing the fact that we have an industrial business zone here.&rdquo; But the city’s response has been a sign that says &ldquo;be careful.&rdquo; State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>said</a>, &ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-precinct-power-to-protect>The Precinct: Power to Protect</h3><p>Precinct 72 has the power to enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can act now. They do not need to wait for another funeral. The tools are in their hands. The question is whether they will use them.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Precinct 72. Tell them to enforce the law, redesign the streets, and end the waiting. Every day of delay is another day someone dies for nothing.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
