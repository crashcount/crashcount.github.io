They had the light. The BMW driver ran the red and kept going. Both men died at the scene. The street was busy. The city was silent. CBS New York <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>reported</a> that since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people</strong> on this two-mile stretch.

Twenty-one suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Most were walking or biking. Most did nothing wrong. The numbers do not lie. The city has known about Third Avenue for years. Plans to fix it have sat on a shelf since 2014. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025.

They spoke of safety. They spoke of families. Councilmember Alexa Avilés <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>called</a> for real investment: &ldquo;We want the city to actually commit real capital to make sure that it can do treatments that truly address the safety concerns while balancing the fact that we have an industrial business zone here.&rdquo; But the city’s response has been a sign that says &ldquo;be careful.&rdquo; State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>said</a>, &ldquo;We should all be offended.

They can act now. They do not need to wait for another funeral. The tools are in their hands. The question is whether they will use them.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Precinct 72.
