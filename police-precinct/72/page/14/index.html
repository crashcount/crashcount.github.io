It did not stop. It hit Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, as they crossed the street. The car sent their bodies flying. The driver ran. Police found him later and charged him with manslaughter and leaving the scene. The men were walking to a food pantry.

Six were seriously hurt. Since 2022, the toll is <strong>13 dead, 2,253 injured, 21 seriously hurt</strong>. Most victims are people on foot or bike. Cars and trucks did the most harm, killing 3 and injuring 209. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1, injured 14. Bikes injured 32. The bodies pile up. The story does not change.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>The city has tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set lower speed limits. The NYPD can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. But on Third Avenue, the city paused a safety plan after business pushback. The deaths followed. Community Board 7 supported the redesign. City Hall stalled. The police can target crash hotspots. They can write tickets. They can save lives. They need to act.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the Third Avenue redesign. Demand real enforcement against speeding and reckless driving. Tell Precinct 72 to protect the people who walk and bike. Do not wait for the next body in the crosswalk.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
