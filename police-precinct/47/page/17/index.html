Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck two mopeds. Both riders were thrown and died at local hospitals. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, then released without bail as the case continued, according to reporters on scene and court records cited in coverage.

A 2019 Mercedes. Two Taizhou mopeds. Two young men, 19 and 21. Both listed as drivers. Both ejected. Both dead. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The dataset records it</a>.</p><h3 id=night-on-the-parkway>Night on the parkway</h3><p>Precinct 47 is busy, and it breaks late. The worst hours stack up after dark. From midnight to 1 a.m., four people have died here since 2022, with heavy injury tallies through the late night and evening peaks, the city’s data show (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>). The Bronx River Parkway alone shows <strong>2 deaths and 220 injuries</strong> in this period in this command. The pattern repeats.</p><p>“Other” factors dominate the fatal column in this precinct, with 14 deaths tagged that way, and three more marked as “vulnerable road user error,” in the same time span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>). Labels don’t stop bodies.</p><h3 id=corners-that-wont-forgive>Corners that won’t forgive</h3><p>The roll‑up of harm names places. <strong>White Plains Road</strong> shows <strong>83 injuries</strong>. <strong>Bronxwood Avenue</strong> shows <strong>3 deaths</strong>. <strong>E 216th Street</strong> shows <strong>4 serious injuries</strong>. The <strong>Bronx River Parkway</strong> shows <strong>2 deaths</strong>. These are this command’s repeat sites, pulled from the city’s log (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians keep taking the hit. Since 2022 in this precinct: <strong>9 pedestrians killed</strong> and <strong>466 injured</strong>. SUVs and sedans are the main striking vehicles in pedestrian cases, with trucks also taking lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>). A 76‑year‑old woman died on White Plains Road at E 216th. The form says “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” “Going Straight Ahead.” She is gone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>).</p><h3 id=a-year-that-got-deadlier>A year that got deadlier</h3><p>In the last 12 months, this command logged <strong>11 deaths</strong>, up from zero in the same stretch a year before. Crashes rose to <strong>1,159</strong>. Reported injuries to <strong>923</strong>. Year‑to‑date deaths jumped to <strong>4</strong> from <strong>0</strong> by this point last year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>). The numbers keep coming; the bodies follow.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one?</h3><p>Start where people are dying. On White Plains Road and Bronxwood, cut turning speeds and clear sightlines. Daylight corners. Add hardened lefts and leading walk times. On E 216th, protect crossings. On the Bronx River Parkway, target the late‑night hours that stack injuries and deaths.</p><p>Then fix the citywide rules that let speed win. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong> and <strong>force repeat speeders to obey the limit with in‑car speed control</strong>. Albany already gave the city new power on speed limits; advocates want it used. Survivors have shown how laws and cameras change behavior. The call is simple. Slow the cars. Hold the worst drivers to account.
