The numbers keep coming; the bodies follow.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one?</h3><p>Start where people are dying. On White Plains Road and Bronxwood, cut turning speeds and clear sightlines. Daylight corners. Add hardened lefts and leading walk times. On E 216th, protect crossings. On the Bronx River Parkway, target the late‑night hours that stack injuries and deaths.</p><p>Then fix the citywide rules that let speed win. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong> and <strong>force repeat speeders to obey the limit with in‑car speed control</strong>. Albany already gave the city new power on speed limits; advocates want it used. Survivors have shown how laws and cameras change behavior. The call is simple. Slow the cars.
