They never made it home. A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then slammed into the riders. Both men were thrown from their scooters and died at the hospital. Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash shut the highway for hours. The road was quiet, except for sirens and the scrape of tow trucks.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 9 people have died and 870 have been injured in Precinct 47.</strong> Eleven suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>4 deaths and 8 serious injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes were all caught in the crossfire. The numbers rise, the bodies pile up. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>Local leaders have the power. They can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and demand enforcement. But the silence is loud. The police have tools—speeding tickets, failure-to-yield tickets, the power to target crash hotspots. They just need to use them. The NYPD can act. They can crack down on reckless driving and protect the most vulnerable. But too often, they wait for the next body. As one report <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>put it</a>, &ldquo;Police said a Mercedes sedan driver struck two men on scooters, who then suffered fatal injuries.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Demand action. Call your council member, your precinct, your mayor. Tell them: No more waiting. No more blood on the parkway.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 25-year-old motorbike rider suffered severe bleeding and was found unconscious, with injuries to his entire body. He was wearing a helmet at the time of the crash. The narrative describes the aftermath: 'His helmet stayed on. His blood did not. He lay still, broken across the road’s hard face.' The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard traffic control and misuse lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
