Early Monday, Aug. 11, on the Bronx River Parkway near East Gun Hill Road, a southbound Mercedes set off a multivehicle crash that threw two young men from their mopeds. “Two men on motorcycles <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/fatal-7-car-crash-on-bronx-river-parkway/>were killed</a> in the crash overnight near East Gun Hill Road, NYPD says.” “Police have <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>arrested and charged</a> a man with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated.”</p><p>At the courthouse, a sister stared at the door. “He&rsquo;s just walking freely? Two people were killed. He was drunk. Think about how he took two lives. That&rsquo;s not fair,” she <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-count-in-precinct-47>The count in Precinct 47</h3><p>The toll does not pause. In the last 12 months, 11 people were killed and 900 were injured across 1,153 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Year to date, there have been 4 deaths, with injuries up 23% and serious injuries up 33% compared with the same time last year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Names fade in the log, but the patterns are there. A 76-year-old woman struck on White Plains Road at E 216th. A man killed on Eastchester Road at Givan Avenue. A motorcyclist dead at Monticello and Strang. The forms read “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” “Unsafe Speed.” “Traffic Control Disregarded.”</p><h3 id=leaders-and-the-law>Leaders and the law</h3><p>The courtroom moved on. The highway reopened. An upstate lawmaker <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>pushed a bail change</a> for felony DWI, but that is Albany’s fight, not a brake pedal in Wakefield. Here, we need fewer fast cars and fewer second chances for speed. Council Member Eric Dinowitz. Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz. State Senator Gustavo Rivera. Your constituents are burying sons.</p><h3 id=what-the-47th-precinct-can-do-now>What the 47th Precinct can do now</h3><p>Precinct 47 does not need a new law to act. It can flood the Bronx River Parkway feeders and White Plains Road with radar. It can write failure-to-yield summonses at E 216th, Givan, and the East 233rd corridor after midnight detours. It can work known hotspots. It can make speed drop.</p><h3 id=do-not-look-away>Do not look away</h3><p>Call the 47th Precinct. Call your council member and legislators. Demand targeted speed enforcement and failure-to-yield blitzes on the streets that keep killing. Then keep calling, until the numbers fall.
