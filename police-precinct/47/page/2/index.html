They never made it home. A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then slammed into the riders. Both men were thrown from their scooters and died at the hospital. Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated.

The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>4 deaths and 8 serious injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes were all caught in the crossfire. The numbers rise, the bodies pile up. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>Local leaders have the power. They can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and demand enforcement. But the silence is loud. The police have tools—speeding tickets, failure-to-yield tickets, the power to target crash hotspots. They just need to use them. The NYPD can act. They can crack down on reckless driving and protect the most vulnerable. But too often, they wait for the next body. As one report <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>put it</a>, &ldquo;Police said a Mercedes sedan driver struck two men on scooters, who then suffered fatal injuries.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Demand action. Call your council member, your precinct, your mayor. Tell them: No more waiting.
