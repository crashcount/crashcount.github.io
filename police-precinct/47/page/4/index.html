Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, 930 crashes tore through the streets of Precinct 47. Seven hundred and one people left bleeding or broken. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children. A 78-year-old woman crossing White Plains Road at night, struck by an SUV, died with head trauma at Jacobi Hospital. The driver stayed. There were no charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>reporting</a></p><p>A football coach, Dwight Downer, stood outside his home. A BMW and a pickup collided. The BMW slammed into parked cars and into him. He died at Jacobi. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said</a>, “These arrests cannot bring back my child.

They can crack down on reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people die. But the carnage continues. In the last year, SUVs killed three pedestrians. Trucks, taxis, sedans—none are blameless. The blood dries, the street reopens, and the next crash waits.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. But the speed limit on these streets is still too high. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. After Dwight Downer’s death, his mother’s <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>words</a> cut through the noise: “I can&rsquo;t believe he was still speeding. But nothing can bring him back to me.”</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> The police can enforce the law. The city can lower the speed limit. The state can keep cameras on. But nothing changes unless you demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them the dead deserve more than words. Demand action. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
