A 24-year-old cyclist died beneath the wheels of a sedan and an SUV at E 233rd Street. A 60-year-old man was crushed by a car while walking on Givan Avenue. In less than three years, ten people have died on the streets of Precinct 47. Seven were walking or cycling. The rest were behind the wheel, but none were spared. Serious injuries—thirty-one in all—leave families changed forever.</p><p>The numbers do not rest. In the last twelve months alone, five people died. 701 were injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is immune. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><h3 id=the-police-power-and-responsibility>The Police: Power and Responsibility</h3><p>Precinct 47 sits at the crossroads of pain and power. The police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They have the tools. They need only use them. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/2024/vision-zero-press-release>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Enforcement is not enough. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. Streets are still wide, fast, and deadly. SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>City Hall says the right things. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/2024/vision-zero-press-release>said Mayor Adams</a>. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to act. But action is slow. Bills pass. Speeches are made. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand enforcement at every corner where someone has died. Demand action until the killing stops. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
