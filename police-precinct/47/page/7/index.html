The numbers keep coming; the bodies follow.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one?</h3><p>Start where people are dying. On White Plains Road and Bronxwood, cut turning speeds and clear sightlines. Daylight corners. Add hardened lefts and leading walk times. On E 216th, protect crossings. On the Bronx River Parkway, target the late‑night hours that stack injuries and deaths.</p><p>Then fix the citywide rules that let speed win. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong> and <strong>force repeat speeders to obey the limit with in‑car speed control</strong>. Albany already gave the city new power on speed limits; advocates want it used. Survivors have shown how laws and cameras change behavior. The call is simple. Slow the cars.

According to the police report, the crash occurred at 1:09 a.m. and involved a 2008 Acura sedan and a 2013 Nissan sedan, both traveling straight ahead. The report details that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor, with one driver also flagged for 'Alcohol Involvement.' The narrative describes airbags bursting and metal folding, leaving four occupants—two drivers and two passengers—injured. Victims suffered crush injuries, with one semiconscious, two incoherent, and one in shock. The force of the collision sent vehicles into parked cars, compounding the destruction. The police report makes clear: unsafe speed and driver recklessness shattered the quiet, leaving bodies broken and a street scarred.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
