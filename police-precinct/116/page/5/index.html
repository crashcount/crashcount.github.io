Twenty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, four deaths and three more lives changed forever. The names fade, but the pain does not. A 44-year-old woman, struck and killed by an SUV on Laurelton Parkway. Three elders—ages 75 and up—dead in crashes. Children injured, futures stolen. The road does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-are-not-accidents>The Crashes Are Not Accidents</h3><p>Speed is the silent killer. On December 25th, a 21-year-old man died behind the wheel of an unlicensed Audi, changing lanes too fast on Laurelton Parkway. On February 8th, a 27-year-old woman was ejected and killed on the Belt Parkway. The cause: <strong>unsafe speed</strong>. The city’s own data shows that <strong>SUVs and cars are the main threat</strong>, with 221 pedestrian injuries or deaths caused by SUVs and cars in this precinct alone.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-cost-of-inaction>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Cost of Inaction</h3><p>The police have the tools.

But for every case that ends in court, dozens more end in silence.</p><p>Victims’ families know the cost. <strong>&ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,&rdquo;</strong> said <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>Keisha Francis</a>, mother of a 14-year-old girl killed in a crash.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 116 can act.</strong> The council can push for lower speed limits and more cameras. The police can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Residents can demand action. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong></p><p>No more waiting.
