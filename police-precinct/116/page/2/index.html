Twenty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, four deaths and three more lives changed forever. The names fade, but the pain does not. A 44-year-old woman, struck and killed by an SUV on Laurelton Parkway. Three elders—ages 75 and up—dead in crashes. Children injured, futures stolen. The road does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-are-not-accidents>The Crashes Are Not Accidents</h3><p>Speed is the silent killer. On December 25th, a 21-year-old man died behind the wheel of an unlicensed Audi, changing lanes too fast on Laurelton Parkway. On February 8th, a 27-year-old woman was ejected and killed on the Belt Parkway. The cause: <strong>unsafe speed</strong>. The city’s own data shows that <strong>SUVs and cars are the main threat</strong>, with 221 pedestrian injuries or deaths caused by SUVs and cars in this precinct alone.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-cost-of-inaction>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Cost of Inaction</h3><p>The police have the tools.

But for every case that ends in court, dozens more end in silence.</p><p>Victims’ families know the cost. <strong>&ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car. I wish they would never think about giving him that car—because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,&rdquo;</strong> said <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>Keisha Francis</a>, mother of a 14-year-old girl killed in a crash.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 116 can act.</strong> The council can push for lower speed limits and more cameras. The police can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Residents can demand action. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong></p><p>No more waiting.

Prosecutors say Fiseku, fleeing police after an attempted burglary, sped through red lights and bike lanes, ultimately hitting Servedio at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. Surveillance captured the chase. The indictment states, 'The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets.' Servedio, 36, was returning from a cycling event and had the right of way. Fiseku abandoned his truck and evaded arrest until February. The case highlights the lethal risk posed by reckless drivers and high-speed police pursuits on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Bekim Fiseku, was wanted for burglary and had tape over his license plate. Police chased him nearly a mile through residential streets. A witness said, "She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood." Fiseku faces murder and manslaughter charges. The case raises questions about the risks of police chases in dense city neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Three others, including a 9-year-old passenger and two adults, had unspecified injuries. According to the police report, 'Other Vehicular' and 'Driver Inexperience' were contributing factors. The dirt bike driver was unlicensed. Helmet use was noted for the dirt bike rider, but only after driver errors. No blame is placed on those hurt. The crash underscores the danger when driver inexperience and vehicle factors collide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
