She never made it home. The van veered off Brookville Boulevard and struck a tree. She was found unconscious in the back seat and died at the hospital. Three others, all seniors, survived but were hurt. Police are still investigating. As <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>police said</a>, &ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday.&rdquo;</p><p>A week earlier, a 27-year-old woman died on the Belt Parkway. The car hit an underpass. Both she and a man with her were found outside the wreck. Police could not say who was driving. As <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>investigators stated</a>, &ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last twelve months, six people died on Precinct 116 streets. Seven more suffered serious injuries. There were 781 injuries and over a thousand crashes. The dead include the old and the young. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-police-and-local-leaders>The Role of Police and Local Leaders</h3><p>Precinct 116 has the tools. Police can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can respond to dangerous conditions. But they must act. The law is not enough if it sits unused.</p><p>Local leaders have spoken about Vision Zero and safer streets. But the deaths keep coming. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras save lives, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Each delay is another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. The city and the precinct can act now. Residents can demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them to lower the speed limit, keep speed cameras on, and enforce the law. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div></div><div class=mod-overlap><details id=other-geos class="other-geos mt4"><summary class="pointer fw6 mb2 f4"><span class="arrow-toggle top-arrow mr2 dn-ns">▸</span> Other Geographies</summary><p class=ml2><span class=fw6>Precinct 116 Police Precinct 116
