An SUV turns left. She does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, two people have died on the streets of Precinct 50. Ten more suffered serious injuries. In that same year, 412 people were hurt in crashes—pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, children. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.

In three years, SUVs alone have killed four people here. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are small. The street is a gauntlet. The old, the young, the careful, the distracted—none are safe.

The driver swerved to avoid a double-parked car. The wall gave way. No one died, but the street was left broken. &ldquo;We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it,&rdquo; <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz</a>. Councilman Eric Dinowitz saw the deeper rot: &ldquo;That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage. I think it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. And we’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced.&rdquo; (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->Councilman Eric Dinowitz comments</a>)</p><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can target the corners where people die. But they need to act. Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These deaths are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safer crossings. Demand that the law protect the living, not just the drivers. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
