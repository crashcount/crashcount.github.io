A black Honda Pilot hit him. Witnesses saw him dragged from under the SUV. &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman,&rdquo; a bystander <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said</a>. There was blood on the street. The driver stayed. The boy did not.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months, Precinct 77 saw 369 injuries and 5 serious injuries from crashes. One person died. In three and a half years, ten people have been killed and over 1,500 injured. Most victims are not in cars. They are walking, biking, or just trying to cross the street.</p><h3 id=the-usual-silence>The Usual Silence</h3><p><strong>No arrests. No charges.</strong> The police investigate. The driver is &ldquo;shocked.&rdquo; The family is left to grieve. &ldquo;He was a boy who loved life. He always had a smile on his face,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said a neighbor</a>. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Precinct 77 has the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. But they must act. Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p><strong>City leaders have new laws.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. Speed cameras now run 24/7. But these changes mean nothing if they stay on paper. The council, the mayor, the precinct—each can act. Each can stall. The numbers do not lie. The dead do not speak.</p><p><strong>Residents must demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name on the news.</strong></p><p><strong>Act now.</strong> The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. It is time to choose safety.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
