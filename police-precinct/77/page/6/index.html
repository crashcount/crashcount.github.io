Nineteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,650 hurt since 2022. The dead include a child, an elderly woman, a cyclist, a moped rider, and too many more. The wounds are not just numbers. They are heads split open on the curb, bodies crushed by trucks, lives ended in the crosswalk.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> They account for nearly all deaths and serious injuries to pedestrians here. One SUV, one truck, one moment of speed or inattention—another life gone. The data shows: <strong>SUVs and cars killed one person, trucks another.</strong> Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death is on four wheels.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. Just last week, a sedan turned into a cyclist on St Johns Place. Last year, a box truck slammed into a worker on Pacific Street. The stories repeat. The faces change. The pain stays.</p><p><strong>“It was just a freak accident. Nothing intentional. I know that he loved her. He loved her dearly.

Love does not stop a car. Grief does not bring back the dead.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The city has started to act—<strong>speed cameras renewed, new slow zones, more daylighted intersections</strong>. But the pace is slow. The deaths are not.</p><p>The police in Precinct 77 can do more. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the asphalt. They can write the tickets that might save a life. They just need to know it matters.</p><p><strong>“Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law.”</strong> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,a%20vision%20%E2%80%94it%27s%20a%20reality">said NYPD Commissioner Tisch</a>.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.
