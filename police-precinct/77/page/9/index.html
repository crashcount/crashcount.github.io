Multiple vehicles traveling east were stopped in traffic when a chain-reaction rear-end collision unfolded. The report identifies "Driver Inattention/Distraction" as a primary contributing factor, along with "Unsafe Speed" for one driver. Two occupants were injured: a 31-year-old female driver and a 38-year-old male passenger, both sustaining back injuries and whiplash. The vehicles involved included sedans and SUVs, with impact points primarily at the center back ends of stopped vehicles. The report explicitly notes driver errors without attributing fault to the victims. No pedestrian or cyclist involvement was reported.

First struck by a box truck, then an SUV, his head shattered, bones crushed. Alone, far from the crosswalk, he became another casualty of unchecked steel and speed.</p><p class=mb3>A deadly crash unfolded midblock on Atlantic Avenue when a 39-year-old man stepped into the roadway and was struck by two vehicles, according to the police report. The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.' Both vehicles—a box truck and a sport utility vehicle—were traveling straight ahead at the time of the collision. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both drivers, offering no further detail on specific driver errors. The pedestrian was crossing the street at a location not marked by a signal or crosswalk, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal impact of large vehicles moving unchecked through city streets, leaving a man dead and unanswered questions in their wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
