The SUV was traveling south and making a left turn when it struck the moped, which was traveling north. The point of impact was the left front bumper of the SUV and the moped was demolished. The SUV driver, who was licensed in California, was found to have alcohol involvement and failed to yield the right-of-way, contributing directly to the crash. The moped driver suffered injuries to his entire body and was conscious but ejected from his vehicle. The report highlights driver errors and impairment as the primary causes, with no contributing factors attributed to the moped rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
