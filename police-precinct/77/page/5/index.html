Five suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. One did not survive. The dead are not numbers. They are children crossing with their sisters, riders thrown from mopeds, elders in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>On June 28, an eight-year-old boy was crossing Eastern Parkway with his sister. A black Honda Pilot struck him. The driver stayed. The boy did not. &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister. She&rsquo;s 17-years-old,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said a neighbor</a>. The police towed the SUV away. No arrest. The street stayed open. The blood washed away.</p><p>A few days before, a 17-year-old on a moped collided with a car. He died at the hospital. His passenger survived. The driver stayed. No arrest. The city moved on. &ldquo;The teenager was riding a gas moped with a passenger on the back&mldr; when it slammed into a Genesis G80 vehicle operated by a 71-year-old man making a left turn,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>police said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-delay>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths here, SUVs and sedans caused the most harm—over 240 incidents, including one death. Trucks and buses killed one and injured more. Motorcycles and mopeds, bikes, and even taxis left their own scars. No one is safe when the street is built for speed.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-silence-and-the-role-of-police>Leadership: Promises, Silence, and the Role of Police</h3><p><strong>The police in Precinct 77 have the tools.</strong> They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can watch the corners where the blood pools and the glass glitters. But action is a choice. The numbers do not lie. The dead do not speak. The silence is loud.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, more enforcement, safer crossings. They can reward courage and call out delay. But every day without action is another day the street claims its own.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-thoughts-and-prayers>Call to Action: Demand More Than Thoughts and Prayers</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong> Do not wait for another child to die in the crosswalk. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
