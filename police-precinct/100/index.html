Six more were left with injuries that will not heal. <strong>Nearly 500 people injured.</strong> The wounds are not just numbers.

Trucks and buses killed none. Cyclists and children are not spared. In the last year alone, 145 people were hurt in 277 crashes. Four were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.

Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong> Call your council member.

Police found him on the tracks around 2:45 a.m. and he was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital. The article quotes NYC Transit President Demetrius Crichlow: “This was as avoidable as it is tragic.” The MTA has updated its “Ride Inside, Stay Alive” campaign, broadcasting warnings every 10 to 15 minutes along the 7 line. The incident highlights ongoing risks in the subway system and the need for effective deterrence and safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian suffered an abrasion and injury to his knee, lower leg, or foot. The report lists 'Passing Too Closely' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the pedestrian’s injury. The driver held only a permit at the time. No vehicle damage was reported. The data shows a clear driver error: passing too closely to a vulnerable road user outside an intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Ten years of pressure forced change. The fleet stands as the most accessible in the nation. Policy, not luck, drove this. Disabled riders gain ground. Streets shift. Access grows.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 5, 2025, that New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) reached a milestone: 50% of active taxis are now wheelchair accessible. TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift. The article highlights systemic progress, not individual driver actions, and underscores the impact of sustained advocacy and regulatory pressure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
