Seven seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, the streets of Precinct 100 have claimed lives and left bodies broken. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the ones who never made it home.</p><p>A 19-year-old woman was killed at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 108th</a> when a driver fell asleep at the wheel. A man, age unknown, died crossing the North Channel Bridge. Another man, 27, was killed on East 1 Road. The list goes on. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong></p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not stop. In June, a cyclist was left with severe facial wounds after a car followed too close on Beach Channel Drive. In July, an elderly pedestrian was struck in a crosswalk. The pattern is clear: <strong>the most vulnerable pay the highest price</strong>.</p><p>The numbers are relentless. Since 2022, there have been <strong>982 crashes, 525 injuries, and 7 serious injuries</strong> in this precinct alone. Cars and SUVs are the main killers, responsible for three out of four deaths.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The city has started to act. Speed cameras now run 24/7. The law lets the city set safer speed limits. But the work is not done. <strong>Every day of delay means another family risks losing someone.</strong></p><p>Police in Precinct 100 can do more. They can target speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can focus on the places where people keep getting hurt. They can make it clear that traffic violence is not fate. It is a choice.</p><h3 id=the-voices-we-cannot-ignore>The Voices We Cannot Ignore</h3><p>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said Ken Baur after a crash in Queens</a>. Eight people were hurt. The driver had fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The crash could have killed. It did not. This time.</p><p>&ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said Jacqueline Cox</a>. The pain is not abstract. It is lived, every day, by survivors and families.</p><h3 id=act-nowdemand-action>Act Now—Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not an act of God. It is a failure of will.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits, real enforcement, and streets built for people, not just cars. Tell Precinct 100: protect the vulnerable. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He died at Jamaica Hospital.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-08-01), a 23-year-old man died after being run over on 101st Street and Liberty Boulevard in Queens. The article reports, "Sonalall approached the driver's side window and flashed what appeared to be a gun, startling the motorist, who then drove off, striking Sonalall." The Queens District Attorney's Office did not charge the driver, citing fear for his life. The incident highlights the lethal risk when vehicles are used in moments of conflict. No charges were filed, raising questions about how self-defense is interpreted in car-related deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
