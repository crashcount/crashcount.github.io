In Precinct 100, people on foot are dying on the big roads: <strong>three pedestrian deaths</strong> since 2022, with 84 injured. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. The toll lives on long corridors where speed feels free and space is wide.</p><ul><li>Beach Channel Drive.</li><li>Cross Bay Boulevard.</li><li>Rockaway Beach Boulevard.</li></ul><p>Police and hospital logs show the hurt spikes at the edges of day and into the night — the 7 a.m. rush, the late afternoon push, and a hard rise at <strong>9–10 p.m. and 2–3 a.m.</strong></p><h3 id=cross-bay-two-deaths-one-bridge>Cross Bay, two deaths, one bridge</h3><p>A person walking on the North Channel Bridge was hit just after 2 a.m. The SUV was going straight north on <strong>Cross Bay Boulevard</strong>. The pedestrian died at the scene. The data lists the cause as “Unspecified.” The body went to the Medical Examiner. The road stayed open. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On another night, a 27‑year‑old driver died at East 1 Road and Cross Bay. The records say <strong>unsafe speed</strong> and <strong>alcohol involvement</strong>. One car. One body. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Cross Bay shows up in the precinct’s hot spots with <strong>two deaths and 28 injuries</strong>.

Speed is in the fatal files. The worst harm to people walking comes from <strong>sedans and SUVs</strong>, which together are tied to most deaths and injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=a-hitandrun-near-jfk-shows-whats-loose>A hit‑and‑run near JFK shows what’s loose</h3><p>A 52‑year‑old man was crossing 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue near JFK at 2:30 a.m. A driver hit him and fled. “The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made,” police said.

Late‑night flight. The record speaks. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway,” the Queens DA said. A jury convicted him.
