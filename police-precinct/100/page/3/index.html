Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Precinct 100, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Four people lost their lives</a>. Six more were left with injuries that will not heal. <strong>Nearly 500 people injured.</strong> The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty chairs, and families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed none. Cyclists and children are not spared. In the last year alone, 145 people were hurt in 277 crashes. Four were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The pain is spread across every age: children, the old, the young who thought they had time.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The headlines do not stop. A <a href=../../crash/4816000/>cyclist struck on Beach Channel Drive</a>. A <a href=../../crash/4793676/>pedestrian crossing with the signal, crushed by an SUV</a>. A <a href=../../crash/4686524/>driver, drunk and speeding, dead at the wheel</a>. Each story is the same. Metal meets flesh. The road runs red. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Laws like Sammy’s Law let New York set its own speed. But the power means nothing if it is not used. <strong>Precinct 100 can enforce the law.</strong> They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, and watch the corners where people die. They can make it stop. But only if they act.</p><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They promise safer streets. But promises do not stop cars. Action does. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong> Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand that the police in Precinct 100 use every tool they have. <strong>Do not let another family join the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 1972 Pontiac sedan behind it, also traveling west, collided with the Nissan's center back end. The Pontiac driver was stopped in traffic. The Nissan driver, a 19-year-old male with a permit license, was cited for driver inattention/distraction and following too closely. Both drivers were conscious and wearing lap belts and harnesses.
