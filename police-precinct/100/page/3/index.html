Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Precinct 100, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Four people lost their lives</a>. Six more were left with injuries that will not heal. <strong>Nearly 500 people injured.</strong> The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty chairs, and families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed none. Cyclists and children are not spared. In the last year alone, 145 people were hurt in 277 crashes. Four were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The pain is spread across every age: children, the old, the young who thought they had time.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The headlines do not stop. A <a href=../../crash/4816000/>cyclist struck on Beach Channel Drive</a>. A <a href=../../crash/4793676/>pedestrian crossing with the signal, crushed by an SUV</a>. A <a href=../../crash/4686524/>driver, drunk and speeding, dead at the wheel</a>. Each story is the same. Metal meets flesh. The road runs red. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Laws like Sammy’s Law let New York set its own speed. But the power means nothing if it is not used. <strong>Precinct 100 can enforce the law.</strong> They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, and watch the corners where people die. They can make it stop. But only if they act.</p><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They promise safer streets. But promises do not stop cars. Action does. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong> Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand that the police in Precinct 100 use every tool they have. <strong>Do not let another family join the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On February 26, Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and crashed into Justin Diaz’s BMW. Diaz, 23, died after being rushed to the hospital. Prosecutors say Pena’s blood-alcohol content was 0.156% and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. Surveillance footage shows Diaz had the right-of-way. The article states, “The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.” Two passengers in Pena’s car were also injured.

A Chevy SUV, driver inattentive, rammed a stopped Jeep. The Jeep’s driver, thirty-four, strapped in, crushed and stunned, hurt everywhere. The crash left pain and shock in its wake.</p><p class=mb3>A 2010 Chevy SUV struck a stopped Jeep from behind near 125th on Cross Bay Boulevard in Queens, according to the police report. The report states that the Chevy SUV was 'going straight ahead' when it collided with the Jeep, which was 'stopped in traffic.' The impact crumpled steel and left the 34-year-old Jeep driver with crush injuries to his entire body. He was found in shock, still strapped in his seat. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor in the crash, underscoring the danger of inattentive driving. No evidence in the report suggests any error or contributing factor on the part of the injured Jeep driver. The collision highlights the risks posed by distracted drivers to everyone on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
