Speed is in the fatal files. The worst harm to people walking comes from <strong>sedans and SUVs</strong>, which together are tied to most deaths and injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=a-hitandrun-near-jfk-shows-whats-loose>A hit‑and‑run near JFK shows what’s loose</h3><p>A 52‑year‑old man was crossing 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue near JFK at 2:30 a.m. A driver hit him and fled. “The driver sped off without stopping.
