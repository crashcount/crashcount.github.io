Forty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,400 hurt since 2022. Each number is a body on the pavement, a family changed forever. In the last year alone, three more lives ended—two of them seniors, one just crossing the street. A 90-year-old woman was struck by a taxi making a U-turn on York Avenue. Seconds later, an SUV hit her again. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. Neither was charged. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.</a></p><p>A day earlier, a Tesla on the FDR flipped and burned. The driver died. Her passenger survived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, bikes—they all draw blood here.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-power-and-silence>Leadership: Promises, Power, and Silence</h3><p>The city has the tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets leaders set safer speed limits. Cameras catch speeders and red-light runners. But the law that keeps those cameras running is set to expire. Local leaders have the power to act. They can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They can demand more enforcement. They can push Albany to keep the cameras on. Some have spoken. Most have not. The silence is loud.</p><p>The police in Precinct 19 can do more. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-action-or-more-names-on-a-list>What Comes Next: Action or More Names on a List</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is another day someone dies.</strong> The city can slow the cars. The precinct can enforce the law. The leaders can speak up or stay quiet. The choice is theirs. The cost is ours.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits, more enforcement, and real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
