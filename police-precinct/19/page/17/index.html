Twelve suffered serious injuries.</strong></p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 71-year-old woman, crossing York Avenue with the signal, was struck and killed by an SUV. The cause: driver inattention.

Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll.</strong></p><p>A 65-year-old e-bike rider was left with a fractured skull on Second Avenue. The driver fled.

Deaths have tripled.</strong></p><p>No new statements from local leaders. No new policies announced. The silence is its own answer.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power to let the street stay deadly. The police can act. The council can act. The mayor can act.
