Advocates say the plan misses the mark.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post reported on May 21, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams announced a $400 million redesign of Fifth Avenue. The plan widens sidewalks by 46% and cuts traffic lanes from five to three, aiming to boost pedestrian access. However, the redesign omits dedicated bus and bike lanes. Advocates criticized the move: 'Two mayors have now disregarded city workers' plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques,' said Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance. Transportation Alternatives called the plan a failure, noting Fifth Avenue's slow bus speeds and lack of cycling infrastructure. The project highlights ongoing policy choices that shape street safety and access for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
