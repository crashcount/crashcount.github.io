An advocate warned: “the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly.” Read <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a> and <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</p><p>Here in Precinct 19, the patterns rhyme: speed, turning drivers, heavy vehicles on narrow blocks, a highway that maims.</p><p>Three fixes. Start today.</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner on York and Second. Harden the turns. Give pedestrians time to step off first with leading intervals. Target the right turns that kill. These address the listed factors: unsafe speed, inattention, failure to yield.</li><li>Calm the FDR’s feeders. Narrow entries. Raised crossings on the frontage roads. Enforce the lights where people cross to the river.</li><li>Protect bike routes through the hot blocks. Physical barriers, not paint, where the injuries cluster.</li></ul><p>Citywide, the steps are on the table.</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit. A slower city saves lives. Albany passed Sammy’s Law to let the city act. Our call is simple: make 20 the norm. See our <a href=/take_action/>call to act</a>: “Lower our residential speed limit to 20 mph citywide.”</li><li>Stop the worst repeat speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act would put speed limiters on the cars that rack up tickets. The bill targets the tiny share of drivers who do the most harm. Our <a href=/take_action/>action page</a> has the numbers and the script.</li></ul><p>Names fade on paper. The corners stay the same.
