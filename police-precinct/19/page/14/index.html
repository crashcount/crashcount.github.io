A yellow cab makes a U-turn. She is struck. A second car hits her again. She dies at the hospital. Both drivers stay. No charges. The street is quiet again, but the blood is not gone. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said. Moments later, a 35-year-old woman driving a 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer also struck her, police said.</a></p><p>A Tesla on the FDR. Too fast. It flips, burns, throws two people out. One woman dead, her passenger survives. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last year, <strong>three people died and 422 were injured</strong> in Precinct 19. Eight were left with serious injuries. Most were walking. Most never saw it coming.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>Eleven killed. Forty-four seriously hurt.</strong> Over 1,400 injured since 2022. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross. SUVs and trucks killed six. Cars and taxis broke bones and lives. Bikes and mopeds left their own scars. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. The law lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit is not lower yet. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany does not act. The police have the power to ticket speeders, to stop reckless turns, to watch the corners where people die. They have the tools. They need to use them.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit now. The precinct can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. The state can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them: Slow the cars. Protect the people. Don’t wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
