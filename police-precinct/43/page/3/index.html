Police charged a 20-year-old with murder. The victim was leaving a car show. The street became a killing ground. Another life ended by violence behind the wheel.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on June 16, 2025, that Keino Campbell, a 27-year-old U.S. Navy veteran, was shot and killed inside his car at Givan Avenue and Palmer Avenue in the Bronx. Police charged Michael Aracena, 20, with murder, manslaughter, and criminal possession of a weapon. The article describes the incident as an 'alleged road rage' shooting but does not detail the events leading up to the violence. Campbell was shot three times in the chest while sitting in his gray 2012 Infiniti sedan. His mother, Suzette Thomas, said, 'I want people to remember my son as a humble person, one to do the best for the world.' The case highlights the lethal risk of violent escalation on city streets and the ongoing threat to vulnerable road users from armed drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police charged the driver with manslaughter. Speeding violations followed the crash. Downer’s family mourns. The street remains unchanged. The danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 8, 2025, that Sheydon McClean, an unlicensed BMW driver, was charged with manslaughter after a November 30 crash killed Dwight Downer, a retired correction officer and football coach, in Baychester. McClean remained at the scene, but police only charged him after further investigation. The article notes McClean’s BMW received at least three speeding violations from city cameras after the fatal crash. Downer’s mother said, 'These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.' The case highlights the ongoing risks posed by unlicensed and repeat speeding drivers, and the limits of enforcement in preventing deadly crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
