Eleven left with injuries so grave they may never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 627 were hurt in crashes. Two of the dead were children under 18. One was a teenager on a moped, thrown from his seat at Metcalf Avenue and East 172nd Street. His name was Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo. He was seventeen. His passenger, a 14-year-old girl, survived. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. No answers. The street was quiet again by morning. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>&ldquo;He was here yesterday morning, sitting on the bed and watching TV. I spoke to him last around 4 p.m.&rdquo;</a> his mother said.</p><p>A 75-year-old man tried to cross White Plains Road. He had the signal. An SUV turned left. He did not make it to the other side. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/bronx-teen-dies-in-traffic-crash-another-teen-injured-nypd-says>The NYPD said the driver failed to yield.</a> The man died at the scene. The driver was not arrested.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-precinct-43>The Role of Precinct 43</h2><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the numbers show the work is not done. In the last year, 1,031 crashes. Two children dead. The same streets see the same pain, again and again.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>City Hall talks about Vision Zero. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to lower speed limits. But the limit here is still 25 mph. The city could drop it to 20 mph tomorrow. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The law that keeps them running is up for renewal. Every delay is a risk. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand that the police use every tool they have. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
