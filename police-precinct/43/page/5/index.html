Since 2022 (through 2025-08-16), 23 people have died, 2,474 were injured, and 42 suffered serious injuries (NYC Open Data). The toll keeps rising.</p><p>This week: two riders, no second chances
On 2025-08-11 two motorcyclists died on the Bronx River Parkway. Police say a drunk driver tried to pass a Volkswagen, struck it, then hit the motorcycles. Both riders were ejected and later died in hospital. Prosecutors charged the 21‑year‑old driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI (NY Daily News; Gothamist; ABC7).</p><p>A winter crosswalk death we must remember
On 2025-02-03 a driver making a left on White Plains Road struck a 75‑year‑old man crossing with the signal. The crash report lists failure to yield and driver inattention. He did not survive (NYC Open Data).</p><p>Where it happens, when it hurts
Two corridors keep repeating: Westchester Avenue and the Cross Bronx Expressway. Nights are deadlier. Deaths spike around midnight and again near 4 a.m., according to precinct crash records. Lighting is poor. Night enforcement is thin.</p><p>What drives the carnage
Local data point to the same culprits: alcohol involvement, driver inattention or distraction, unsafe speed, and failure to yield. Cars and SUVs cause most pedestrian deaths and injuries here.</p><p>What Precinct 43 can do now</p><ul><li>Run sustained night patrols at Westchester Avenue and the Cross Bronx service roads. Focus on late‑night passes and lane weaving.</li><li>Use daylighting and Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) at the worst turns. Add targeted lighting at known midnight/early‑morning hotspots.</li><li>Write the tickets that change behavior: failure‑to‑yield, unsafe speed, DWI. Publish results.</li></ul><p>What leaders must do — local + citywide
Council Member Amanda Farías, Assembly Member Emérita Torres, and Senator Jose Serrano must fund fixes here and push citywide change. Lower New York City’s default speed limit. Require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders and drivers who rack up repeated camera or DMV violations. Those two moves — slower streets and tech that limits chronic speeding — cut deaths where they happen and citywide (CrashCount Take Action resources).</p><p>Act
This is preventable. Demand night enforcement at precinct hotspots, daylighting and LPIs at dangerous turns, better lighting, a lower default speed citywide, and speed‑limiting tech for repeat offenders. Tell Precinct 43 and City Hall this is not normal. Start here: /take_action/.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
