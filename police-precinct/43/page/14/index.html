In the last year, <strong>nine people died</strong>. <strong>Fifteen more were left with injuries so grave they may never heal</strong>. The youngest lost was a child. The oldest, a man walking home from mosque, struck in the crosswalk. He tried to wave the driver off, but the car kept coming. “The accident is so terrible. I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>said his neighbor</a>.</p><p><strong>Six hundred nineteen injured in twelve months.</strong> Some were walking. Some were riding. Some were just in the wrong place when metal met flesh. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>On the Hutchinson River Parkway, a chain-reaction crash threw an 18-year-old woman from a scooter. The driver left her on the asphalt. She fought for her life in the hospital. “The moped driver sped away&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>reported the Daily News</a>. Six others were hurt. No one has been held to account.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-delays-and-the-waiting-dead>Leadership: Words, Delays, and the Waiting Dead</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on drivers who fail to yield. They can flood the hotspots. But the carnage continues. In the halls of power, leaders talk of Vision Zero and safer streets. But in Precinct 43, the numbers keep climbing. <strong>Two deaths this year so far. Eight serious injuries.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-the-only-way-out-is-through>What Now: The Only Way Out Is Through</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made somewhere up the chain. If you want change, make noise. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand tickets for drivers who don’t yield. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
