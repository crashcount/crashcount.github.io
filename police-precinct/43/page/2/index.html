The shooter, Joseph Meeks, 76, tried four credit cards before the argument escalated. ABC7 reports, "Mr. Barrie asked him to get out of the car and pay him, instead of paying him he shot him in the stomach." Meeks, with about 60 prior arrests, was charged with attempted murder. The United Federation of Taxi Drivers urged the district attorney to deny bail.
