The sedan's right front bumper made contact with the bicyclist, causing abrasions to her knee, lower leg, and foot. The bicyclist was not ejected and sustained injury severity level 3. The report explicitly cites "Passing Too Closely" as the contributing factor. No damage was recorded on either vehicle. The bicyclist was not wearing any safety equipment. The driver’s failure to maintain safe passing distance directly caused the collision and injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
