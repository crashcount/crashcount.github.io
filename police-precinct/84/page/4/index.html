In Precinct 84 since 2022: <strong>4 dead, 1,298 injured</strong> across 3,000 crashes. Pedestrians hurt 246 times. Cyclists, 197. Buses and trucks still hit people here.</p><ul><li>Pedestrians were most often struck by sedans and SUVs: 85 by sedans, 55 by SUVs, 26 by trucks, 9 by buses (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>The worst hours stack up in daylight and dusk.

Deaths hit at 8 a.m., 3–4 p.m., 8 p.m., and 11 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Unsafe speed and “other” driver actions lead the harm. “Other” accounts for 373 injuries. Distraction is next. Failure to yield keeps showing up.

Fifty-six injured. Four were left with serious wounds. The corner with Jay Street took a 74‑year‑old on an e‑bike when a bus turned right; the rider was killed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><p>Cadman Plaza West. Sixteen injured and one dead. In 2022, a speeding SUV with reported aggressive driving killed a 76‑year‑old passenger near Furman Street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><p>Flatbush Avenue Extension. Sixty-six injured.

It is a record. On Furman and Cadman, the city’s data lists “Unsafe Speed” and “Aggressive Driving/Road Rage” for the 2022 fatal crash that trapped two people and killed one (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-slow-the-cars>Fix the corners, slow the cars</h3><p>Start at the hotspots. Daylight every corner around <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary Street</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cadman Plaza West</a>. Harden right turns for buses and trucks at Jay, Navy, and the Flatbush Extension. Give walkers a head start with LPIs. Put concrete where paint fails. Then repeat at the next cluster.</p><p>Target the hours when injuries surge: late mornings through the school rush and evening peaks. Enforce failure‑to‑yield at the crosswalk. Keep trucks to safe routes during the worst windows. Do not wait for another obituary line in the dataset (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-end-this>Citywide tools that end this</h3><p>The city now has the power to set lower speeds. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. A 20 mph default would cut deaths. “A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph,” our own advocates note. The law lets City Hall act now (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>).</p><p>Repeat speeders do outsized harm. Vehicles piling up camera tickets are far more likely to kill. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the worst drivers to use speed‑limiters after 16 camera tickets in a year or 11 DMV points in 18 months. Pass it, then enforce it (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>).</p><p>This precinct shows the pattern. The names change. The corners don’t. Slow the cars. Fix the turns. Use the laws we have.</p><p>Take one step today.

Laws failed to stop her.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (April 16, 2025) reports that Miriam Yarimi, a repeat traffic offender, faces charges after killing Natasha Saada and her two daughters in Brooklyn. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez said, "Yarimi's dangerous driving killed three members of a Brooklyn family." Yarimi had 21 speeding and five red-light tickets, yet current laws did not prevent her from driving. Gonzalez noted, "Current laws limit the DA's ability to pursue murder charges in such cases and called for legislative review." The article highlights gaps in automated enforcement, as tickets do not affect a driver's record or insurance. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes has proposed requiring speed limiters for repeat offenders. The crash has sparked calls for stronger laws and enforcement against dangerous drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
