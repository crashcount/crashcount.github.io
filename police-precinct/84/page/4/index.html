Twenty-two left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last three and a half years, this is the price paid in Precinct 84. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps. These numbers are not just statistics—they are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> They struck, they crushed, they killed. Bikes and trucks left their mark too, but the weight of the carnage falls on the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not stop. On April 7, a 26-year-old cyclist was cut open and left bleeding after a crash with an SUV on Atlantic Avenue. The wound was deep. The pain will last. In November, a 74-year-old man died when a bus turned and crushed him as he rode his e-bike through the intersection at Tillary and Jay. He was ejected. He did not survive.</p><p>On State Street, a woman in the back seat of an SUV was killed. The crash report lists her as “Apparent Death.” The cause: unsafe speed, aggressive driving. No one walks away from that.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can crack down on reckless driving. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. But the violence keeps coming. The numbers do not lie: 1,207 injured, 22 seriously, since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They talk about safer streets. But the bodies keep piling up. The city has started to lower speed limits and redesign streets, but the pace is slow. The police can do more. They must do more.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at every hotspot. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On April 16, 2023, Trujillo drove his Volvo at 72 mph—nearly triple the speed limit—through a red light at Atlantic Ave and Clinton Street in Brooklyn. He struck pedestrian Katherine Harris, 31, killing her instantly, then rear-ended another car and crashed into an outdoor dining shed. Trujillo's blood alcohol level was .17, more than twice the legal limit. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "This defendant made a disastrous decision when he got behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated." The case highlights the lethal consequences of impaired driving and excessive speed, underscoring systemic risks for pedestrians in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
