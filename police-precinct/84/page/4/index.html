Twenty-two left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last three and a half years, this is the price paid in Precinct 84. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps. These numbers are not just statistics—they are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> They struck, they crushed, they killed.

On April 7, a 26-year-old cyclist was cut open and left bleeding after a crash with an SUV on Atlantic Avenue. The wound was deep. The pain will last. In November, a 74-year-old man died when a bus turned and crushed him as he rode his e-bike through the intersection at Tillary and Jay. He was ejected. He did not survive.</p><p>On State Street, a woman in the back seat of an SUV was killed. The crash report lists her as “Apparent Death.” The cause: unsafe speed, aggressive driving. No one walks away from that.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can crack down on reckless driving. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. But the violence keeps coming. The numbers do not lie: 1,207 injured, 22 seriously, since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They talk about safer streets. But the bodies keep piling up. The city has started to lower speed limits and redesign streets, but the pace is slow. The police can do more. They must do more.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at every hotspot. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police say Miriam Yarimi drove with a suspended license, no insurance, and expired registration, and ran a red light. She faces multiple charges, including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The crash also injured an Uber driver and passengers.

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated offenses, targeting those with 11 or more points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years. The bill mirrors laws for drunk driving and follows stalled efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act. Governor Hochul's office declined comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their son remains hospitalized. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 21 speeding tickets—15 in school zones—over two years. Lawmakers and advocates called for legislation requiring speed limiter devices on cars of drivers with more than six camera violations. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said the driver 'clearly would've met the threshold.' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crash 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' The bill aims to prevent repeat offenders from exceeding speed limits.

A driver with a suspended license crashed into them after slamming another car. The family was walking home. The street turned deadly. Nine more were hurt. System failed to keep danger off the road.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (March 29, 2025), a mother and her two young daughters were killed in Brooklyn when Miriam Yarimi, driving with a suspended license, struck them after colliding with an Uber. The article states, "Yarimi reportedly has a history of reckless driving, with 15 school zone speeding and red-light tickets in the last 12 months, and over $10,000 in fines." NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called it "a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The crash left nine injured, including the family's 4-year-old son in critical condition. Both drivers were expected to be tested for drunken driving. Yarimi had not been charged at the time of reporting. The case exposes lapses in enforcement and persistent risks from repeat traffic offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On April 16, 2023, Trujillo drove his Volvo at 72 mph—nearly triple the speed limit—through a red light at Atlantic Ave and Clinton Street in Brooklyn. He struck pedestrian Katherine Harris, 31, killing her instantly, then rear-ended another car and crashed into an outdoor dining shed. Trujillo's blood alcohol level was .17, more than twice the legal limit. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "This defendant made a disastrous decision when he got behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated." The case highlights the lethal consequences of impaired driving and excessive speed, underscoring systemic risks for pedestrians in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
