Twenty-two left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last three and a half years, this is the price paid in Precinct 84. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps. These numbers are not just statistics—they are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm.</strong> They struck, they crushed, they killed. Bikes and trucks left their mark too, but the weight of the carnage falls on the biggest machines.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not stop. On April 7, a 26-year-old cyclist was cut open and left bleeding after a crash with an SUV on Atlantic Avenue. The wound was deep. The pain will last. In November, a 74-year-old man died when a bus turned and crushed him as he rode his e-bike through the intersection at Tillary and Jay. He was ejected. He did not survive.</p><p>On State Street, a woman in the back seat of an SUV was killed. The crash report lists her as “Apparent Death.” The cause: unsafe speed, aggressive driving. No one walks away from that.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>The police have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can crack down on reckless driving. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. But the violence keeps coming. The numbers do not lie: 1,207 injured, 22 seriously, since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero.</strong> They talk about safer streets. But the bodies keep piling up. The city has started to lower speed limits and redesign streets, but the pace is slow. The police can do more. They must do more.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at every hotspot. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses.
