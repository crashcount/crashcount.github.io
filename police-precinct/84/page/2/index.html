Twenty-two left with injuries so severe they changed lives. In the last twelve months, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Precinct 84 saw 798 crashes</a>. Two people never made it home. One was a 74-year-old man, thrown from his e-bike and crushed by a turning bus at Tillary and Jay. Another was a 45-year-old woman, a passenger, killed on State Street when two cars collided. A child’s knee was crushed by a car that failed to yield. These are not numbers. They are empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-maim>The Machines That Maim</h2><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Sedans and SUVs caused 55 pedestrian injuries, including seven serious ones. Trucks and buses added eleven more. Bikes left ten injured, one seriously. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. No corner is safe. No hour is sacred. The violence is steady, unbroken.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-families-wait>Leaders Talk, Families Wait</h2><p>After a crash killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn, leaders gathered at Borough Hall. The driver had a suspended license and a record of speed and red-light violations. State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said</a>, <em>&ldquo;It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act&rdquo;</em>. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher was blunt: <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>&ldquo;A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>Yet the bills stall. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act lapsed. The &ldquo;Stop Super Speeders&rdquo; bill waits. The city has the power to lower speed limits, but the limit stands. The police have the tools to enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target the places where bodies hit the pavement. They just need to act.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct. Demand action. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement at crash hotspots. Demand that every death is treated as a crime, not a cost of doing business. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose differently.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pedestrian sustained injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot, and complained of whiplash. The report explicitly identifies the driver’s failure to yield and distraction as the causes, with no contributing fault attributed to the pedestrian.
