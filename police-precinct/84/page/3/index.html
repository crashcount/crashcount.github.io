The city will close the cut-through, ban parking at corners, and add pedestrian space. Confusion and blocked sight lines fueled crashes. Change comes after loss and pressure.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on April 28, 2025, that the city will close a dangerous Bushwick intersection after a fatal crash killed motorcyclist Philippe Haussmann. The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
