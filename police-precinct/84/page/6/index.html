A 74-year-old man, thrown from his e-bike, dead under the wheels of a bus at Tillary and Jay. A 45-year-old passenger, chest crushed, dead on Flatbush. Four deaths in Precinct 84 since 2022. <strong>One every few months.</strong></p><p>In the last year alone, 334 people were hurt, four left with injuries so severe they may never walk right again. Two did not survive. Children are not spared. Ten under 18 were injured, two seriously. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> They broke bones and ended lives—49 moderate injuries, 7 serious, just in the last three years. Trucks and buses hit hard too. Bikes and motorcycles add to the toll, but the weight of steel does most of the damage.</p><p>On Court Street, the city plans a protected bike lane. The reason is plain: &ldquo;Court Street&rsquo;s not great, all the way Downtown Brooklyn is just double parked cars. So it&rsquo;s you feel like you&rsquo;re taking your life in your hands a little bit. My son&rsquo;s school is actually on Court, so I can&rsquo;t avoid it fully,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/06/dot-proposes-protected-bike-lane-for-court-street-this-summer>said Ryan Greet</a>. The city’s own numbers show 165 crashes, one death, 15 cyclists and 23 pedestrians hurt on that mile of street in two years. Most pedestrians were hit while crossing with the light.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-and-the-law>The Leaders and the Law</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of action.</strong> After a mother and her two daughters were killed by a driver with a suspended license and a record of violations, State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it&rsquo;s time for us to act.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to install speed cameras. It has the power to enforce the law. The police in Precinct 84 can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, and target the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Tell them you want slower streets, more enforcement, and real protection for people who walk and bike. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
