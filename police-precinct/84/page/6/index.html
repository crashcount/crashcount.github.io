Multiple vehicles traveling south were stopped in traffic when the collision happened. The report identifies 'Following Too Closely' as the primary contributing factor leading to the crash. A 48-year-old male driver, restrained by a lap belt and conscious after the incident, suffered a head injury and concussion. The vehicles involved included a 2024 BMW sedan, a 2012 Nissan sedan, and a 2022 Toyota SUV. The point of impact was primarily at the center back end and rear bumpers, indicating a rear-end collision sequence. The driver errors cited focus on the failure to maintain safe distance, which triggered the chain-reaction crash.

One sedan was making a U-turn while the other was traveling straight north. The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors to the crash. A 55-year-old female passenger suffered a head injury with significant bleeding but remained conscious. Additional occupants, including a 31-year-old female driver and two passengers aged 9 and 15, sustained neck injuries consistent with whiplash. The report emphasizes that driver errors—specifically unsafe speed and failure to obey traffic controls—were central to the collision and resulting injuries.
