Distraction and failure to yield paved the way.</p><p class=mb3>A 2007 Toyota sedan, traveling north and making a left turn at Jay Street and Prospect Street in Brooklyn, struck a 54-year-old man who was crossing in the crosswalk with the signal. According to the police report, the contributing factors were “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.” The pedestrian suffered hip and upper leg injuries and reported pain and nausea. The vehicle’s right front bumper was the point of impact, consistent with a turning strike. The driver was licensed and male. Driver errors—distraction and failure to yield—are documented as primary causes in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The lane, once shielded from traffic, will be replaced with an unprotected version. NY1 notes, 'The lane is being shifted from its current position next to the sidewalk to the other side of parked cars.' This change eliminates the physical barrier that separated cyclists from moving vehicles. The move raises questions about city policy and the safety of vulnerable road users on this busy Brooklyn stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
