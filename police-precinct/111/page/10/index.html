In court, he said he entered “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people.” The Queens DA said he “terrorized other drivers.” A judge gave him eight years. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a> reported the plea and the sentence.

Protect the bike movement through the junction.</li><li>Cross Island Parkway: repeated deaths in the corridor. Limit access points. Add barrier and refuge where on‑ and off‑ramps meet local streets. Target high‑injury hours with automated enforcement.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>In this precinct, the data flags “other” as the lead contributing factor for deaths and injuries. Vulnerable road user error trails far behind. Speed and turns still break bodies, even when the form says “unspecified.” Source: contributing factors.</li><li>The worst harm clusters on the highways and big arterials. The rollup shows SUVs and cars as the chief source of pedestrian injury and death.</li></ul><p>Citywide levers, local lives</p><ul><li>Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, locking in a tool that cuts speeding where installed. That fight is won. The next one is speed everywhere and the worst repeat offenders. See our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>The law now lets the city set lower speeds. A citywide 20 mph default would slow crashes like the ones that kill on Northern and Hollis Court. The call is simple. Make it the rule. See <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Repeat speeders do outsized harm across the city. The proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would force the worst to use speed limiters. It targets cars that rack up camera tickets and points. See <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>What we can say, and what we can count</p><ul><li>This is Precinct 111.
