She died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>They were one of <strong>12 people killed</strong> on streets in Precinct 111 since Jan 1, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

The loss is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On these precinct streets, drivers turning and going straight hit people on foot and on bikes. The datasets show recurring factors like inattention and failure to yield among the named entries, and unsafe speed in multiple fatal cases, including a 24-year-old killed on the Cross Island Parkway about 2:30 AM on Aug 26, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-map-doesnt-lie>The map doesn’t lie</h3><p>The worst injuries and deaths stack up on the same corridors: the Cross Island Parkway, the Long Island Expressway, and the Clearview Expressway (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Target speeding on and off the ramps. Enforce yielding at turns on Northern Blvd. Daylight corners and harden turns at problem intersections. These are the places where people bleed. The records are clear (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=citywide-steps-within-reach>Citywide steps within reach</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. New York City can set safer defaults and rein in repeat speeders. Two steps matter here: drop the default speed on local streets and require speed limiters for drivers who rack up violations. Both are on the table; both would cut harm that shows up in this precinct’s rolls.
