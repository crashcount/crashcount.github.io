Prosecutors said Pena sped at 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Diaz’s BMW. Pena admitted at the scene, 'I ran the light. I hit him.' Toxicology reports showed alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana in his system, with a blood-alcohol level well above the legal limit five hours after the crash. Surveillance footage captured the collision. Pena had a history of traffic violations, including 25 speeding tickets in two years.

The report cites 'Backing Unsafely' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle alone. The pedestrian sustained head injuries and was in shock. The vehicle had no visible damage, indicating the impact was likely at low speed but severe enough to cause injury. The report explicitly identifies the driver’s failure to safely back and maintain attention as the cause. No victim fault or contributing pedestrian behaviors were noted in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly twice the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article notes, 'Police charged Pena with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing to take a breath test.' Surveillance footage confirmed Pena had been drinking for hours before the crash.
