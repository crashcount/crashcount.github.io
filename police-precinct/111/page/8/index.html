The SUV, traveling west, collided with a sedan also traveling west that was changing lanes. The point of impact was the SUV's right front quarter panel and the sedan's left front bumper. A parked bus was also involved, sustaining damage to its left rear bumper. The injured driver was wearing a lap belt and harness and was not ejected.

The street held no intersection, only danger and steel.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, an 80-year-old pedestrian was walking with traffic along 48th Avenue near 206th Street at dusk when a westbound car 'passed too close.' The vehicle's right front bumper struck the man's head, causing severe lacerations and bleeding. The report notes that the pedestrian remained conscious at the scene. The crash did not occur at an intersection. The primary contributing factor cited is 'Passing Too Closely,' a clear driver error. The report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The narrative documents the impact, the injuries, and the absence of intersection controls, underscoring the peril faced by those on foot when drivers fail to maintain safe distance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
