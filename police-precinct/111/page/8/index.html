Twenty seriously hurt. Nearly two thousand injured</strong> since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 75-year-old woman, struck while crossing 47th Avenue. A 17-year-old, ejected from a speeding sedan on the Cross Island Parkway. The road does not care about age.</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs took two lives and left dozens bleeding. Trucks and buses added more wounds. No bikes killed anyone here. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city says it is fighting. Speed cameras now run day and night. The law lets New York lower speed limits. But the work is not done. <strong>&ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/senior-pedestrian-moped-rider-killed-in-separate-nyc-crashes-in-24-hours/>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>.

The driver stays. The family grieves. The street stays dangerous.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-111>The Role of Precinct 111</h3><p><strong>Precinct 111 can do more.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep dying. They have the tools. They need to use them. The city has the laws. It needs to act.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. <strong>Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
