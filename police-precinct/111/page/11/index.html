The datasets show recurring factors like inattention and failure to yield among the named entries, and unsafe speed in multiple fatal cases, including a 24-year-old killed on the Cross Island Parkway about 2:30 AM on Aug 26, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-map-doesnt-lie>The map doesn’t lie</h3><p>The worst injuries and deaths stack up on the same corridors: the Cross Island Parkway, the Long Island Expressway, and the Clearview Expressway (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

New York City can set safer defaults and rein in repeat speeders. Two steps matter here: drop the default speed on local streets and require speed limiters for drivers who rack up violations.
