An SUV keeps going. He does not get up. He is 57. The record says &ldquo;crush injuries.&rdquo; Another day, another body on the street. In the last twelve months, three people have died in Precinct 20. Seven more suffered serious injuries. Two of the dead were over 65. One was 55. The old do not walk fast enough for the city.</p><p>A cyclist, 74, is struck by a bus at West End Avenue and 70th. Helmet or not, it does not matter. He is gone. The numbers do not show the blood on the street, or the silence after. In total: 200 injured, 3 dead, 7 seriously hurt in just one year. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Waiting</h3><p>The city says it will act. The mayor calls traffic violence a crime.

But the dead do not see police at the corner. The city passed Sammy’s Law. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always about to expire. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program is gone. No more mandatory safety courses for repeat offenders.</p><p>Families march. They hold signs with names. &ldquo;This epidemic is preventable. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>said Darnell Sealy-McCrorey</a>. The city listens, then waits.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-20-power-and-responsibility>The Role of Precinct 20: Power and Responsibility</h3><p>Precinct 20 can act. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where bodies fall. They have the tools. They need only to use them. Every delay is another name on the list.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand Precinct 20 enforce the law.</p><p>The city will not save you unless you make it. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pursuit ended when the SUV crashed near Dyckman Street and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV, then drove off without attempting to help the driver or calling an ambulance.' The driver died at the scene, unidentified and burned beyond recognition. The officers failed to report the crash to supervisors and signed off for the day. Both were suspended as the NYPD and Attorney General investigate. The incident follows a recent NYPD policy change that bars pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' The case highlights risks of police pursuits and questions about adherence to new policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
