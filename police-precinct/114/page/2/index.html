Two pedestrians and the 84‑year‑old driver were killed when a car crashed into a food cart and nearby people. An eyewitness said, “I have never seen anything like this.” (amNY: <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/</a>)</p><p>2024-10-22 — A cyclist was killed on 34th Avenue at 37th Street at night, according to city crash records.

Northern Boulevard and 34th Avenue show up in the data again and again. 42nd Street is a recurring danger. Crashes spike around 08:00, in mid‑afternoon, at the 17:00 rush and late at night. That pattern points to daylighting, lighting gaps and night enforcement failures.</p><p>The data show common contributing factors such as failure to yield and inattention/distraction, with unsafe speed noted in many reports. Cars and SUVs cause the bulk of pedestrian injuries here; trucks and buses show up less often but still create life‑threatening crashes.</p><p>Fixes that work and can be done locally: daylight unsighted corners and remove parking that blocks sight lines; install leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs) at turn‑conflict intersections; harden left‑turn geometry with protected turn lanes and centerline separation on 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard; run sustained, targeted speeding details and night patrols during the deadly hours.</p><p>Queens prosecutors showed what accountability can sound like. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said after a sentencing this month.

Precinct 114’s patterns demand city answers: lower New York City’s default speed limit to 20 mph and require speed‑limiting technology for habitual speeders. Sammy’s Law gives the city power to set safer limits; state action to force intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders would lock in protections.
