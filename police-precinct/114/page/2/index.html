Twenty left with serious injuries. Over 2,600 hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are lives ended, bodies broken, families changed forever. In the last year alone, one person died and three suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, cyclists, and pedestrians. The youngest was just a teenager. The oldest, a senior who did not see the car coming.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage does not stop. Last October, a 36-year-old woman riding her bike was killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. She was struck by a truck and a sedan. She wore a helmet. It did not matter. The crash left her body broken, her life ended in the street. In June, a 17-year-old boy died as a passenger in a sedan on Astoria Boulevard. The car was speeding. It did not stop. The boy never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data records the deaths</a>, but the pain is not in the spreadsheet.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. They pass laws. They hold press conferences. But the streets do not change fast enough. The police have the power to act. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people keep dying. They just need to use the tools they have. As one survivor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said after a crash</a>, &ldquo;I was holding on for my life back there.&rdquo; Another <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>said</a>, &ldquo;Jewel was already dead when she flew out the car.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-action>The Next Step: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell the 114th Precinct to crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college. The case highlights repeated driver violations and systemic failures in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
