In the last twelve months, <strong>1 person died and 354 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes. Three suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p>Last fall, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was hit and killed at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She was returning from a ride. The driver was fleeing police. A witness said, <em>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>).

The violence is steady, not sudden. It is a slow bleed.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can demand lower speed limits, daylight corners, and redesign deadly crossings. They can push the precinct to enforce speed and failure-to-yield laws. They can speak up or stay silent. The police can target crash hotspots, ticket reckless drivers, and protect the most vulnerable. Every week without action is another week of risk.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Contact your council member, your precinct, and the mayor.
