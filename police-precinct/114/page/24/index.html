Hundreds wounded.</strong> In the last twelve months, Precinct 114 saw 669 crashes. One person died. Three were left with injuries so grave they may never heal. Three hundred fifty-nine more were hurt. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in the street, families in waiting rooms, shoes left behind on the curb.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway. It hit the divider, vaulted into oncoming traffic, and slammed into two cars. Six people were hurt. Two are fighting for their lives. Police said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>&ldquo;speed may have been an issue&rdquo;</a>. The NYPD closed the road and sent in the Collision Investigation Squad. The scene was fire and twisted steel. The cause was simple: a driver lost control. The cost was paid by everyone in his path. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/05/fiery-bmw-crash-on-queens-highway-leaves-2-in-critical-condition/>&ldquo;A BMW driver and a passenger were fighting for their lives Saturday after their out-of-control luxury car vaulted into oncoming traffic on the Belt Parkway in Queens, slamming into two unsuspecting motorists in a fiery crash, the NYPD said.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h3><p><strong>Leadership has tools. They have laws. They have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the carnage continues. The police can enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hit. They just need to use the power they already have.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed two people here. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt dozens more. Trucks, buses, and bikes all play their part. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the harder the blow.</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-yours>The Next Move Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement.
