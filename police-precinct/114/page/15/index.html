The motorcyclist, a 22-year-old male, was injured with abrasions to his elbow and lower arm but was conscious and not ejected. The report cites 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Unsafe Lane Changing' as contributing factors, indicating driver errors by the motorcyclist. The motorcycle's left front quarter panel and the SUV's right front quarter panel were points of impact. The motorcyclist was unlicensed, wearing a helmet, and the SUV driver was licensed.
