Fourteen people have died since 2022. Twenty-one suffered serious injuries. The wounded number in the thousands. Each number is a life changed or ended. Each crash is a story that does not end well.</p><p>Just last month, a 17-year-old boy died in the front seat of a sedan on Astoria Boulevard. The crash report lists “unsafe speed” and “traffic control disregarded.” The car was being chased by police. The boy never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 36-year-old woman on a bike was killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. A pickup truck going straight. A life ended in the crosswalk. No helmet could save her. No law of physics could stop the force of a truck.</p><h3 id=buses-bikes-and-the-unforgiving-road>Buses, Bikes, and the Unforgiving Road</h3><p>The violence does not spare the young. A 15-year-old moped rider was killed by a bus on 43rd Street. The record says “crush injuries.” No further detail. The pain is left to the family.</p><p>Buses jump curbs. Eight people were hurt when an MTA bus slammed into a pole in Flushing. One rider <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said</a>, “I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.” Another <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said</a>, “It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus.”</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>The city has lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket for speeding, failure to yield, reckless driving. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They just need to act.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They can push for more speed cameras, safer street designs, and real accountability for repeat offenders. But every delay is another name on a report, another family left with empty arms.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-enforcement-and-real-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Enforcement and Real Change</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand they use every tool—speed enforcement, failure-to-yield tickets, and real crackdowns on dangerous drivers. Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
