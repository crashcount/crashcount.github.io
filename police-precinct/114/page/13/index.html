Nearly three thousand injured.</strong> Twenty-one left with wounds so deep they are called serious. These are not numbers. They are people. They lived in Astoria, in Ravenswood, in the shadow of the bridge. They crossed the street. They rode a bike. They waited for the light. Now they are gone, or changed forever.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 39-year-old moped rider was killed at 23rd Avenue and 37th Street.</strong> The crash report lists &ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded&rdquo; and &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; The rider was ejected, helmet on, but it did not matter.

The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.
