Twenty more are left with injuries so severe they are called serious.</strong> Since 2022, more than 2,600 have been hurt. Every week, the count grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway. It hit the divider, vaulted into oncoming traffic, and caught fire. <strong>Two young lives ended.</strong> Three more in the car survived. The drivers they struck survived too, but not unchanged. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>&ldquo;No one in the doomed BMW was wearing a seat belt.&rdquo;</a> The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad closed the road and began to count the cost. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>&ldquo;Speed may have been an issue,&rdquo;</a> police told reporters. The rest is silence.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs have done the most harm.</strong> They killed two, left 282 with minor injuries, and 111 with moderate wounds, plus 4 serious injuries. Trucks and buses injured 30 more, including 2 serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds left 27 hurt. Even bikes are not blameless—15 injuries, one serious. The young are not spared. <strong>Two children have died.</strong> Over 190 have been injured. The oldest victim was 75. The youngest was not old enough to vote.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city has tools. The precinct has power. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target the places where blood stains the street. They can act. Sometimes they do. But often, they wait.</p><p>The city has started to lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the carnage continues. <strong>Every day of delay is another day a family waits for a call that never should come.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member.

According to the police report, the woman was belted and seated upright when the impact tore open the airbag and left her bleeding out in her seat.

The police narrative states: 'A pickup struck a westbound sedan’s side. The front passenger, 29, belted and still, bled out in her seat. Airbag torn open. Harness tight across her chest.
