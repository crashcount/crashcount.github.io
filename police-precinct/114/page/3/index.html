A 17-year-old died as a passenger in a speeding car. The list goes on. Each crash is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has new tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits. Speed cameras now run 24/7. But in this precinct, the pace of change is slow. Streets remain wide, crossings long, corners blind. Police have the power to enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can act. Too often, they don’t.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 114 is not helpless.</strong> The police can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Local leaders can demand safer street designs, more daylighted corners, and real accountability for repeat offenders. Residents can call, write, and show up until the killing stops.</p><p><strong>Don’t wait for another name on the list. Demand action. Call your council member, your precinct, your mayor.

On February 26, Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and crashed into Justin Diaz’s BMW. Diaz, 23, died after being rushed to the hospital. Prosecutors say Pena’s blood-alcohol content was 0.156% and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. Surveillance footage shows Diaz had the right-of-way. The article states, “The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.” Two passengers in Pena’s car were also injured.

A 2024 Jeep sedan was making a right turn when it collided with two vehicles—a 2014 Acura sedan and a 2016 Hyundai SUV—both stopped in traffic heading south. The point of impact was the left front bumper of the turning sedan against the left rear quarter panel of the Acura and the left front bumper of the Hyundai.
