Three dead in Astoria, just days ago. An 84-year-old driver sped through a stop sign at 19th Avenue and 42nd Street, slammed into a food truck, and killed two men ordering coffee. The car spun and hit another vehicle. The street was left with wreckage and grief. “Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>said George Giakoumis</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> and <strong>990 have been injured</strong> in crashes in Precinct 114. Six suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not get second chances.

A 15-year-old moped rider crushed by a bus on 19th Avenue. A pedestrian struck by a bus at Ditmars and 31st. The numbers do not lie: <strong>over 5,500 crashes</strong> since 2022. <strong>Sixteen dead. Nearly 3,000 injured.</strong></p><p>The stories repeat. Streets built for speed, not safety. “It&rsquo;s a very bad feeling because. It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s hard. Nobody deserves this type of end, you know? Maybe this time it was my brother. Maybe next time it could be anybody,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>said Abelardo Venancio</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. But speed kills, and the city drags its feet. The police have the tools: they can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can act, or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Precinct 114 can save lives.</strong> But only if it chooses to. Every day of delay is another day of risk for people on foot, on bikes, at the curb.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member, your precinct, your mayor. Tell them the dead deserve better. Tell them to enforce the law, slow the cars, and protect the people who walk these streets. Do not wait for another headline.

TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift.
