Fourteen people have died since 2022. Twenty-one suffered serious injuries. The wounded number in the thousands. Each number is a life changed or ended. Each crash is a story that does not end well.</p><p>Just last month, a 17-year-old boy died in the front seat of a sedan on Astoria Boulevard. The crash report lists “unsafe speed” and “traffic control disregarded.” The car was being chased by police. The boy never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 36-year-old woman on a bike was killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. A pickup truck going straight. A life ended in the crosswalk. No helmet could save her. No law of physics could stop the force of a truck.</p><h3 id=buses-bikes-and-the-unforgiving-road>Buses, Bikes, and the Unforgiving Road</h3><p>The violence does not spare the young. A 15-year-old moped rider was killed by a bus on 43rd Street. The record says “crush injuries.” No further detail. The pain is left to the family.</p><p>Buses jump curbs. Eight people were hurt when an MTA bus slammed into a pole in Flushing. One rider <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said</a>, “I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.” Another <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said</a>, “It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus.”</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>The city has lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket for speeding, failure to yield, reckless driving. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They just need to act.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. They can push for more speed cameras, safer street designs, and real accountability for repeat offenders. But every delay is another name on a report, another family left with empty arms.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-enforcement-and-real-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Enforcement and Real Change</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand they use every tool—speed enforcement, failure-to-yield tickets, and real crackdowns on dangerous drivers. Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors say Rosen pursued William McField, a 55-year-old motorcyclist, after a minor collision. On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes." The case highlights the lethal risk of aggressive driving and the need for stronger enforcement against road violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college.
