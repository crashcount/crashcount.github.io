A third died behind the wheel. It was morning rush.</p><p>On August 12, at 8:36 a.m., a Volvo SUV turned left at 42nd Street and 19th Avenue. Two men were in the roadway. A Toyota sedan came north. The SUV hit the men. The Toyota hit the SUV. The men died. The 84‑year‑old driver died too. That is what the city’s database shows for <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4834594</a>.</p><h3 id=a-cyclist-doesnt-make-it-home>A cyclist doesn’t make it home</h3><p>On October 22, 2024, at 34th Avenue and 37th Street, a 36‑year‑old woman rode east. A Dodge pickup came east. A BMW sat parked. The pickup’s left front hit her. She was ejected and died. The record lists “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Aggressive Driving/Road Rage” as factors in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4765626</a>. She wore a helmet. It didn’t matter.</p><h3 id=where-the-hurt-piles-up>Where the hurt piles up</h3><p>Since 2022, Precinct 114 has logged 5,560 crashes, 3,004 injuries, and <strong>19 deaths</strong>. SUVs and cars led the harm to people on foot: <strong>SUVs</strong> caused 161 pedestrian injuries, including 3 deaths; <strong>sedans</strong> caused 209 pedestrian injuries, including 1 death. Heavy vehicles also did damage: trucks and buses together caused 40 pedestrian injuries and 1 death. These figures come from precinct totals in the period covered.</p><p>Pain has a clock. The worst hours stack at night and dawn: 11 p.m. shows 3 deaths; 4 a.m. shows 2; 2–3 a.m., more injuries; 8 a.m. is brutal too, with 5 deaths and 147 injuries. That is the precinct’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly pattern</a>.</p><p>One corridor bleeds again and again. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Northern Boulevard</a> has 134 injuries and six serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>34th Avenue</a> shows three deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Grand Central Parkway</a> holds a death and 162 injuries.</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say-about-blame-and-blood>What the numbers say about blame and blood</h3><p>In precinct rollups, the biggest bucket is “other,” tied to 9 deaths and 863 injuries. A smaller share is pinned on people walking or riding, listed as “vulnerable road user error,” with 1 death and 166 injuries. Distraction. Failure to yield. Blown signals. They are all there, smaller counts, steady harm. This is from the precinct’s contributing‑factor file in the dataset.</p><h3 id=queens-voices-you-cant-unhear>Queens voices you can’t unhear</h3><p>Some drivers take the road like a weapon. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said a wrong‑way driver “terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars.” She added: “Two motorists were badly hurt and still have not fully recovered.” Those lines come from an Aug. 15 report on a Clearview Expressway case in <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. The driver himself said, “You want to fight?” and admitted he entered the expressway the wrong way “because I wanted to hurt people,” according to the same <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>report</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-that-kill>Fix the corners that kill</h3><p>Start with the simple work on Northern Boulevard, 34th Avenue, and Grand Central Parkway service roads: daylight the crosswalks; add hardened left turns; give people a head start with leading pedestrian intervals; post no‑turn‑on‑red at conflict points; route and slow trucks near schools and parks. Target the dark hours where the deaths spike. The city’s own numbers point to these corners and clock times.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-cut-the-speed>Citywide tools that cut the speed</h3><p>Speed is the lever. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, as advocates noted, but the next moves are bigger: drop New York’s default speed limit and force repeat offenders to obey the limit.</p><p>The city already has the power to lower speeds under Sammy’s Law, and advocates are pressing for a default 20 mph. Our site lays out the steps to push City Hall and DOT to act; see our <a href=/take_action/>guide</a>. Repeat speeders do outsized harm. One analysis found that just 1.5% of motorists account for 21% of pedestrian deaths, and 30 or more camera tickets multiplies risk fifty‑fold. Those figures and the push for mandated intelligent speed assistance for recidivists are detailed in our <a href=/take_action/>action page</a>, which cites the underlying reports.</p><p>Lower the limit. Box in the worst drivers. The numbers in this precinct already tell you why.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Mercedes, driven by FDNY firefighter Michael Pena, T-boned Diaz’s car. Surveillance footage showed Diaz entering the intersection as the pedestrian signal allowed crossing. Pena was arrested at the scene and charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing a breath test. The FDNY suspended Pena without pay. Two Mercedes passengers were hospitalized.

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.
