Twenty seriously hurt. Over 2,600 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are people. A cyclist crushed at night. A teen bled out in a seat. A pedestrian struck on a quiet street. The disaster does not come all at once. It comes day after day, year after year.</p><p>Just last month, a BMW vaulted a divider on the Belt Parkway and slammed into oncoming cars. <strong>Six people were hurt, three left fighting for their lives.</strong> Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/belt-parkway-car-accident-queens-leaves-several-injured/16968309/>said the driver then struck a gray 2016 CR-V, as well as a red 2022 Hyundai</a>. The road closed. The city moved on.</p><p>A year ago, a 15-year-old on a moped was killed at 19th Avenue and 43rd Street. A cyclist died at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. The list grows. <strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds take their share. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has new tools. Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. More daylight at crossings. But the work is not done. The police have the power to act. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target the corners where people keep dying. They can write the tickets that save lives.</p><p>But too often, the focus drifts. The NYPD investigates after the fact. The <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>Collision Investigation Squad was probing the wreck</a>. The lanes reopen. The cycle repeats.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 114 can do more.</strong> The tools are there. The need is plain. Every crash is a warning. Every delay is a risk. The dead cannot speak. The living must demand action.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The blood is fresh. The clock is running.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
