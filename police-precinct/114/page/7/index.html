They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt.

Two sedans traveling westbound were involved. One vehicle, a 2017 Audi, was stopped in traffic when it was struck in the center back end by a 2015 Jeep going straight ahead. The Jeep driver was cited for driver inattention/distraction. The 24-year-old male driver of the Audi suffered a neck injury and contusion but was not ejected and remained conscious, wearing a lap belt.
