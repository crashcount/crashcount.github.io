Twenty-one left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In just over three years, Precinct 114 has seen 5,200 crashes. <strong>More than 2,700 people hurt.</strong> The dead include children, cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. The living carry scars—some seen, most not.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>Last week, an MTA bus in Queens jumped the curb at 57th Road and Main Street. Eight people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; But after reviewing the video, officials said he &ldquo;had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo; The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo;</a> said one passenger.

It does not say who waited for him to come home.

Motorcycles and mopeds left one dead, one seriously hurt. Bikes, too, have left their mark—one dead, one seriously hurt. The numbers are small. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has new tools. Speed limits can be lowered. Cameras can catch the reckless. But change comes slow. The police in Precinct 114 have the power to enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, reckless turns. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, enforce the law, and make the streets safe for the living.
