In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>774 were injured</strong>. Five suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. The numbers do not heal. They only grow.</p><p>Just last fall, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was riding home in Astoria. A pickup, chased by police, ran her down at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She flew thirty feet. She did not scream. &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; a witness told the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>Daily News</a>. Servedio was 36. She was coming back from a cycling event. She had the right of way. The driver sped off. The police stopped to help her, but it was too late.</p><p>Last week, two people on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were hurt. The NYPD said only, &ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>reported CBS New York</a>. No word on charges. No word on why.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-police-and-local-leaders>The Role of Police and Local Leaders</h3><p><strong>Precinct 114 has the power to act.</strong> Police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But they must see the problem first. They must choose to act.</p><p>Local leaders have tools. The city can lower speed limits. The council can demand safer street designs. But action is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-ours>The Next Step Is Ours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made somewhere—by a driver, by a city, by a leader who looked away. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names. They are families left with empty rooms.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong></p><p>The street remembers every name we forget.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
