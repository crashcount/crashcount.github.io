It is 5:30 p.m., outside Our World Neighborhood Charter School. A seven-year-old girl is struck. Her femur snaps. Her head hits the curb. A 14-year-old girl and a 58-year-old man are hit too. The driver has no license. Police charge her with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license. The street is stained. The sidewalk is not safe. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>An out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult outside a Queens charter school during the Thursday evening rush, leaving a 7-year-old girl with a broken femur, according to police and sources.</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> in Precinct 114. <strong>Five suffered serious injuries.</strong> Eight hundred and one were hurt. Two of the dead were children. One was a cyclist. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. SUVs and sedans alone killed two, and left more than a hundred with moderate or serious injuries. Bikes, mopeds, and trucks added to the toll. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies, broken and gone.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras run day and night now. The law allows lower speed limits. But the blood keeps coming. Residents <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/queens-crash-children-run-over-driver-charges/>call for increased safety measures, like speed bumps</a>. The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. But they must act.

The police have the power. The leaders have the spotlight. But the children still bleed on the sidewalk. The old are pinned under vans. The cyclist does not get up. <strong>Demand more.
