Twenty-one left with injuries so grave they change a life. In just over three years, this is the cost in Precinct 114. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at 2 a.m., the blood on the crosswalk, the shoes left behind.</p><p>Just last week, a 39-year-old moped rider was killed at 23rd Avenue and 37th Street. He was thrown from his seat, helmet on, but it did not matter. The crash report lists &ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded&rdquo; and &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; The man died at the scene. The street was quiet again by dawn (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><p>A year ago, a 17-year-old boy died as a passenger in a sedan on Astoria Boulevard. No helmet, no chance. The car was one of three tangled in a police pursuit. The city moved on. The family did not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars are the main threat. In this precinct, they have killed two, seriously injured four, and left more than 400 hurt. Trucks and buses have injured dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, often unlicensed, add to the toll. Bikes injure, but they do not kill. The street is a battlefield, and the dead are almost always on foot, on two wheels, or riding as passengers.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-the-law>The Leaders and the Law</h2><p>Local leaders have tools. They have laws. They have the power to act. The police can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. But the work is not done. The city has lowered some speed limits and expanded speed cameras, but the carnage continues. The numbers do not lie.</p><p>After a bus crash in Queens, a shaken passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us.&rdquo; Another crash survivor, thrown from a burning BMW, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>remembered</a>, &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo;</p><p>Precinct 114 can do more. The police can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. They can make it clear that every death is one too many.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-action-demand-life>Call to Action: Demand Action, Demand Life</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Every day of delay is another family broken. The blood is still fresh.
