In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>774 were injured</strong>. Five suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. The numbers do not heal. They only grow.</p><p>Just last fall, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was riding home in Astoria. A pickup, chased by police, ran her down at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She flew thirty feet. She did not scream. &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; a witness told the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>Daily News</a>. Servedio was 36. She was coming back from a cycling event. She had the right of way. The driver sped off. The police stopped to help her, but it was too late.</p><p>Last week, two people on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were hurt.
