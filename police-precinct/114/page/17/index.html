A third died behind the wheel. It was morning rush.</p><p>On August 12, at 8:36 a.m., a Volvo SUV turned left at 42nd Street and 19th Avenue. Two men were in the roadway. A Toyota sedan came north. The SUV hit the men. The Toyota hit the SUV. The men died. The 84‑year‑old driver died too. That is what the city’s database shows for <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4834594</a>.</p><h3 id=a-cyclist-doesnt-make-it-home>A cyclist doesn’t make it home</h3><p>On October 22, 2024, at 34th Avenue and 37th Street, a 36‑year‑old woman rode east. A Dodge pickup came east. A BMW sat parked. The pickup’s left front hit her. She was ejected and died. The record lists “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Aggressive Driving/Road Rage” as factors in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4765626</a>. She wore a helmet. It didn’t matter.</p><h3 id=where-the-hurt-piles-up>Where the hurt piles up</h3><p>Since 2022, Precinct 114 has logged 5,560 crashes, 3,004 injuries, and <strong>19 deaths</strong>. SUVs and cars led the harm to people on foot: <strong>SUVs</strong> caused 161 pedestrian injuries, including 3 deaths; <strong>sedans</strong> caused 209 pedestrian injuries, including 1 death. Heavy vehicles also did damage: trucks and buses together caused 40 pedestrian injuries and 1 death. These figures come from precinct totals in the period covered.</p><p>Pain has a clock. The worst hours stack at night and dawn: 11 p.m. shows 3 deaths; 4 a.m. shows 2; 2–3 a.m., more injuries; 8 a.m. is brutal too, with 5 deaths and 147 injuries. That is the precinct’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly pattern</a>.</p><p>One corridor bleeds again and again. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Northern Boulevard</a> has 134 injuries and six serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>34th Avenue</a> shows three deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Grand Central Parkway</a> holds a death and 162 injuries.</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say-about-blame-and-blood>What the numbers say about blame and blood</h3><p>In precinct rollups, the biggest bucket is “other,” tied to 9 deaths and 863 injuries. A smaller share is pinned on people walking or riding, listed as “vulnerable road user error,” with 1 death and 166 injuries. Distraction. Failure to yield. Blown signals. They are all there, smaller counts, steady harm. This is from the precinct’s contributing‑factor file in the dataset.</p><h3 id=queens-voices-you-cant-unhear>Queens voices you can’t unhear</h3><p>Some drivers take the road like a weapon. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said a wrong‑way driver “terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars.” She added: “Two motorists were badly hurt and still have not fully recovered.” Those lines come from an Aug. 15 report on a Clearview Expressway case in <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. The driver himself said, “You want to fight?” and admitted he entered the expressway the wrong way “because I wanted to hurt people,” according to the same <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>report</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-that-kill>Fix the corners that kill</h3><p>Start with the simple work on Northern Boulevard, 34th Avenue, and Grand Central Parkway service roads: daylight the crosswalks; add hardened left turns; give people a head start with leading pedestrian intervals; post no‑turn‑on‑red at conflict points; route and slow trucks near schools and parks. Target the dark hours where the deaths spike. The city’s own numbers point to these corners and clock times.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-cut-the-speed>Citywide tools that cut the speed</h3><p>Speed is the lever. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, as advocates noted, but the next moves are bigger: drop New York’s default speed limit and force repeat offenders to obey the limit.</p><p>The city already has the power to lower speeds under Sammy’s Law, and advocates are pressing for a default 20 mph. Our site lays out the steps to push City Hall and DOT to act; see our <a href=/take_action/>guide</a>. Repeat speeders do outsized harm. One analysis found that just 1.5% of motorists account for 21% of pedestrian deaths, and 30 or more camera tickets multiplies risk fifty‑fold. Those figures and the push for mandated intelligent speed assistance for recidivists are detailed in our <a href=/take_action/>action page</a>, which cites the underlying reports.</p><p>Lower the limit. Box in the worst drivers. The numbers in this precinct already tell you why.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
