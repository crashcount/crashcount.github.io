Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead include a three-year-old girl, struck while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother survived with wounds. The SUV kept turning.

They have choices.</strong> The city now has the power to lower speed limits. The law lets them set 20 mph as the default. But the limit still stands above that on most streets. The police can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, reckless turns. They can target the corners where blood stains the crosswalks. They can act, or they can wait.</p><p>The numbers show the cost of waiting. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, ten seriously hurt, 282 injured</strong>. The toll falls hardest on the young and the old. Twenty-two children hurt. Twenty-seven seniors. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries, 178 were caused by cars and SUVs, 18 by trucks and buses, 8 by bikes, and 6 by mopeds. The weight of steel wins every time. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>When leaders cut corners, people pay.

The sedan's point of impact was its right front bumper, while a stopped SUV nearby showed damage to its left front quarter panel. The driver errors of disregarding traffic control and unsafe speed directly contributed to the collision. The pedestrian was conscious and injured but was not at fault.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The street claimed another life.</p><p class=mb3>A 59-year-old man riding an e-bike was killed when a northbound bus struck him at Lenox Avenue and West 138th Street in Manhattan, according to the police report. The report states, 'A 59-year-old man on an e-bike was struck by a northbound bus. His head was crushed. He died there, unconscious, in the dark, as the city slept around him.' The bus and e-bike were both reported as going straight ahead before the crash. The police report lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are specified in the data, but the fatal impact between the bus and the vulnerable cyclist resulted in a deadly head injury. The e-bike rider was not using any safety equipment, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the absence of specified driver errors. The crash took place just after midnight, underscoring the ongoing danger faced by cyclists on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
