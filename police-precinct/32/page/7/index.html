Who Will Stop the Killing on Lenox Avenue?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 10, 2025 <em>(Revised July 17, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Precinct 32: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 10, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-blood-on-the-asphalt>The Blood on the Asphalt</h3><p>A child is dead. A three-year-old girl, crossing Lenox Avenue with her mother, was struck and killed by an SUV turning left at West 135th Street. Her mother survived with wounds and memories that will not heal. Both crossed with the signal. The SUV kept moving. The city kept moving. The numbers do not stop. In the past twelve months, 2 people have died and 264 have been injured in 491 crashes in Precinct 32. Nine of those injuries were serious. One of the dead was a child. One was over 55. The rest of us keep walking, keep waiting.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. In this precinct, they account for the majority of deaths and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Buses, trucks, and bikes leave their own scars, but the weight of the carnage comes on four wheels. The city’s own data shows the pattern. The faces change. The story does not.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has new tools. Sammy’s Law gives New York the power to lower speed limits. The law is on the books. The power sits unused. The police have the means to enforce the law, to crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They know the hotspots. They know the hours. They know the names. But knowing is not doing. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-words-of-the-street>The Words of the Street</h3><p>After the crash at Lenox and 135th, there were no speeches. Only the sound of sirens and the scrape of glass. In another crash, a cyclist was killed by a bus at Lenox and 138th. The record shows only the time, the place, and the word: &ldquo;Killed&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in city data</a>.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement at every deadly corner. Demand action for every name turned into a number. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
