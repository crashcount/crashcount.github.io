Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead include a three-year-old girl, struck while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother survived with wounds. The SUV kept turning.

They are lives, gone in the space between one green light and the next.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-leadership-action-and-silence>The Role of Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have choices.</strong> The city now has the power to lower speed limits. The law lets them set 20 mph as the default. But the limit still stands above that on most streets. The police can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, reckless turns. They can target the corners where blood stains the crosswalks. They can act, or they can wait.</p><p>The numbers show the cost of waiting. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, ten seriously hurt, 282 injured</strong>. The toll falls hardest on the young and the old. Twenty-two children hurt. Twenty-seven seniors. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries, 178 were caused by cars and SUVs, 18 by trucks and buses, 8 by bikes, and 6 by mopeds. The weight of steel wins every time. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>When leaders cut corners, people pay.

The report states the sedan driver was 'distracted' and failed to maintain lane position, citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The cyclist was ejected from his bike, landing head-first and suffering severe bleeding, with injuries focused on the head. The police report describes the aftermath: 'He flew, landed head-first. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He lay conscious, bleeding.' The bike was left twisted on the street. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is listed after the primary driver errors. The collision highlights the lethal consequences when drivers fail to pay attention and maintain proper lane discipline.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident occurred early in the morning when the motorcycle, traveling south, lost control on slippery pavement and collided head-on with a southbound SUV. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor. The rider, who was helmeted, was ejected from the motorcycle and suffered severe head trauma, resulting in apparent death at the scene. The motorcycle was described as 'demolished,' and blood was visible on the road. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage. No driver errors such as speeding or failure to yield are cited in the report, but the hazardous road surface is explicitly noted. The victim's helmet use is mentioned in the police report after the primary contributing factor of the slick pavement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
