Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead include a three-year-old girl, struck while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother survived with wounds. The SUV kept turning.

They have choices.</strong> The city now has the power to lower speed limits. The law lets them set 20 mph as the default. But the limit still stands above that on most streets. The police can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, reckless turns. They can target the corners where blood stains the crosswalks. They can act, or they can wait.</p><p>The numbers show the cost of waiting. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, ten seriously hurt, 282 injured</strong>. The toll falls hardest on the young and the old. Twenty-two children hurt. Twenty-seven seniors. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries, 178 were caused by cars and SUVs, 18 by trucks and buses, 8 by bikes, and 6 by mopeds. The weight of steel wins every time. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>When leaders cut corners, people pay.
