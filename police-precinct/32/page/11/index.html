She is three. An SUV turns left. She is gone. Her mother is left standing in the street, blood on her hands, the signal still green. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One sharp turn, one small life lost</a>.</p><p>A cyclist rides up Lenox at night. A bus and an e-bike meet at the corner. The cyclist does not get up. The street is quiet again, but the loss lingers. In Precinct 32, <strong>four people have died</strong> since 2022. <strong>Twenty-five suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, <strong>two deaths, seven serious injuries, and 282 hurt</strong>. The numbers do not rest. They do not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-police-and-the-silence-of-power>The Role of Police and the Silence of Power</h3><p>The police in Precinct 32 have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless turns and failure to yield. They can stand at the corners where blood has dried and say, Not here, not again. But the streets stay dangerous. The numbers keep rising. <strong>510 crashes in the last year.</strong></p><p>When Devon Hughley was killed by a fleeing driver, his neighbors called him a local hero. His sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>said the arrest brought some peace</a>.
