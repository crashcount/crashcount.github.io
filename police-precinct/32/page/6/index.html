Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead include a three-year-old girl, struck while crossing with the signal at Lenox and 135th. Her mother survived with wounds. The SUV kept turning. The street kept moving. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A 59-year-old man on a bike was crushed by a bus at Lenox and 138th. A forty-two-year-old motorcyclist died on Harlem River Drive. These are not numbers. They are lives, gone in the space between one green light and the next.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-leadership-action-and-silence>The Role of Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have choices.</strong> The city now has the power to lower speed limits. The law lets them set 20 mph as the default. But the limit still stands above that on most streets. The police can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, reckless turns. They can target the corners where blood stains the crosswalks. They can act, or they can wait.</p><p>The numbers show the cost of waiting. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, ten seriously hurt, 282 injured</strong>. The toll falls hardest on the young and the old. Twenty-two children hurt. Twenty-seven seniors. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and SUVs.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries, 178 were caused by cars and SUVs, 18 by trucks and buses, 8 by bikes, and 6 by mopeds. The weight of steel wins every time. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>When leaders cut corners, people pay. When the city delays, families grieve. The numbers do not change until the streets do.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think we all know [cyclists] are going to be there anyway, whether you accommodate them or not&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said CB 5 Transportation Committee Chair David Sigman</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement at the corners where people die.

The report states the sedan driver was 'distracted' and failed to maintain lane position, citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The cyclist was ejected from his bike, landing head-first and suffering severe bleeding, with injuries focused on the head. The police report describes the aftermath: 'He flew, landed head-first. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He lay conscious, bleeding.' The bike was left twisted on the street. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is listed after the primary driver errors. The collision highlights the lethal consequences when drivers fail to pay attention and maintain proper lane discipline.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
