She is three. An SUV turns left. She is gone. Her mother is left standing in the street, blood on her hands, the signal still green. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One sharp turn, one small life lost</a>.</p><p>A cyclist rides up Lenox at night. A bus and an e-bike meet at the corner. The cyclist does not get up. The street is quiet again, but the loss lingers. In Precinct 32, <strong>four people have died</strong> since 2022. <strong>Twenty-five suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, <strong>two deaths, seven serious injuries, and 282 hurt</strong>. The numbers do not rest. They do not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-police-and-the-silence-of-power>The Role of Police and the Silence of Power</h3><p>The police in Precinct 32 have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless turns and failure to yield. They can stand at the corners where blood has dried and say, Not here, not again. But the streets stay dangerous. The numbers keep rising. <strong>510 crashes in the last year.</strong></p><p>When Devon Hughley was killed by a fleeing driver, his neighbors called him a local hero. His sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>said the arrest brought some peace</a>.

An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.' The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor infractions.

Busway stretches from 3rd to 9th Avenue. Residents protest. They say more buses, not fewer cars, would help. Officials push ahead. Tensions flare. Policy shifts, but questions remain on safety and congestion.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (June 14, 2025), City Hall approved a plan to ban cars on 34th Street between 3rd and 9th Avenues, creating a dedicated busway. The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life."

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

Federal threats landed flat. Letters flew. Deadlines passed. The fight over Manhattan’s tolls moved to courtrooms. Officials called the process a sham. Transit funding hung in the balance. Streets stayed dangerous. Cars kept coming.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published May 22, 2025), the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) refused to halt Manhattan’s congestion pricing despite a fourth federal deadline. The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.' The federal government’s push to end the tolls, and the MTA’s resistance, highlight a clash over control of city streets and transit funding. No mention of driver actions, but the policy fight leaves vulnerable road users exposed as the legal battle drags on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Buses get priority. Cars must turn off. Goal: faster rides, fewer crashes. Officials cite 14th Street’s gains—speed up, crashes down. Change comes for Midtown. Riders wait for relief.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on May 20, 2025, that New York City’s Department of Transportation proposed a dedicated busway for 34th Street between 3rd and 9th Avenues. The plan aims to boost bus speeds by 15% for tens of thousands of daily riders. Private cars and taxis could enter but must turn off at the first legal opportunity. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'After seeing tremendous success on 14th Street where buses have sped up, traffic has virtually disappeared, and far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes we are excited to propose a similar design on 34th Street.' The 14th Street busway, launched in 2019, increased bus speeds by up to 24% and reduced crashes. The 34th Street plan seeks similar safety and efficiency gains, with community input shaping the final design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
