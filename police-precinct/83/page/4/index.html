Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, five dead, nine with wounds that will not heal. <strong>Four hundred forty-nine injured.</strong></p><p>A man stands in a Bushwick crosswalk. A car hits him, throws him ten feet. The driver flees.

He drove again. He killed again.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Silence</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks.</strong> Vans, sedans, SUVs, box trucks. They kill. They maim. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Bikes too, but the numbers are smaller. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the bodies keep coming. The silence is heavy.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits. Cameras can catch speeders. But every day of waiting is another risk. The law is there. The action is not. <strong>Precinct 83 can do more.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone with power. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where people live, not die.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next name. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
