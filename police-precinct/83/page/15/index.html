Year‑to‑date, this precinct has logged 779 crashes, up 23.5% from 631 at this point last year. Injuries are up to 448 from 308. Recorded deaths are down, 1 this year versus 4 last year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 71‑year‑old woman never made it across Knickerbocker Ave at Eldert St on May 9, 2024. Police recorded the driver as unlicensed, going at unsafe speed, and disregarding traffic control. She died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4723690</a>).</p><p>“Speed cameras have cut speeding by over 60% in locations where installed,” the State Senate recorded when the program was renewed (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/senate-protects-new-york-students-and-pedestrians>NYS Senate</a>).

A box truck driver failed to yield to a man crossing with the signal at Halsey and Irving on Aug 29, 2025. The pedestrian was hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Add targeted enforcement for failure‑to‑yield and red‑light running on these blocks. Shift truck routes and add turn‑calming where box trucks mix with crosswalks. These are standard tools; this precinct needs them most at the repeat sites documented above (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-bills-that-would-spare-the-next-family>The bills that would spare the next family</h3><p>The city now has the power to lower speeds. A citywide 20 MPH default and all‑hours camera enforcement work together; lower limits make every mistake survivable, and cameras curb repeat harm. Albany has a bill to stop habitual speeders with intelligent speed assistance; it’s laid out <a href=/take_action/>here</a>. The act would force the worst offenders to obey the limit, not just pay tickets.</p><p>This is the district of Council Member <a href=/council-district/37/>Sandy Nurse</a>, Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/53/>Maritza Davila</a>, and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/18/>Julia Salazar</a>. Their constituents are the ones getting hit at these corners. The question is simple: will they push the fixes and back the bill?</p><p>Eight dead since 2022. Four crash scenes in a day.
