He never made it. The driver kept going. Police found the man dead in the street. They said the vehicle might have been a garbage truck, but the driver was gone before sunrise. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, five people have died on these streets. Twelve more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch: 560 injured, 1 in 15 a child. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=patterns-in-blood-and-asphalt>Patterns in Blood and Asphalt</h3><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 26-year-old cyclist, killed at Evergreen and Hart. A 59-year-old man, crossing with the signal, crushed by a van at Wyckoff and DeKalb. A 65-year-old moped rider, ejected and left to die on Putnam Avenue. Each crash a story cut short. Each one preventable.</p><p>The killers are not ghosts. They drive sedans, vans, trucks, mopeds. They fail to yield. They run red lights. They do not stop. In the last year, cars and SUVs injured over 275 people here. Trucks and buses, 27. Motorcycles and mopeds, 25. Bikes, 12. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-waiting-and-what-comes-next>Leadership: Words, Waiting, and What Comes Next</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can stand at the corners where people die and make it stop. But the dying continues.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for slower speeds, safer crossings, and real consequences for those who kill. They can act, or they can wait for the next body.</p><p>The waiting is a choice. &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-feel-the-heat>Call to Action: Make Them Feel the Heat</h3><p><strong>Call your council member.
