According to the NYPD, 'a man driving a cargo van struck both of them while making a left turn.' Gil died from her injuries; her aide was hospitalized. Police did not arrest or charge the driver. The article notes that Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year, and cites Transportation Alternatives: '46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year.' The crash highlights the ongoing risk seniors face on city streets, especially at intersections where turning vehicles endanger those crossing on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The vehicle's left front bumper was the point of impact. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot, classified as injury severity level 3, but remained conscious. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. The pedestrian was crossing without a signal, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor. The driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred.

The moped rider, a 31-year-old man, was partially ejected and suffered severe bleeding from his arm, remaining conscious at the scene. The report describes the impact as centered on the front ends of both vehicles. The SUV, a 2008 Cadillac, and the moped were both traveling straight before the crash. The police narrative underscores the chaos: 'A moped hit head-on by an SUV. The rider, 31, thrown partway off, bleeding hard from his arm. He stayed awake. Both drivers distracted.' The crash highlights the lethal consequences of driver distraction, with the vulnerable moped rider bearing the brunt of the impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
