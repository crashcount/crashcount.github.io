Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, five dead, nine with wounds that will not heal. <strong>Four hundred forty-nine injured.</strong></p><p>A man stands in a Bushwick crosswalk. A car hits him, throws him ten feet. The driver flees. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux lists the damage: &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>he told ABC7</a>.

He was only 29 years old and lit up every room he entered.

He drove again. He killed again.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Silence</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks.</strong> Vans, sedans, SUVs, box trucks. They kill. They maim. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Bikes too, but the numbers are smaller. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But the bodies keep coming. The silence is heavy.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits. Cameras can catch speeders. But every day of waiting is another risk. The law is there. The action is not. <strong>Precinct 83 can do more.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone with power. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where people live, not die.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next name. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact was severe: 'A Jeep slammed into a northbound moped. The 65-year-old rider flew from the seat, struck the pavement headfirst. Blood pooled in the street. The SUV’s front end folded. He died there.' The moped rider, a 65-year-old man, was killed instantly, suffering fatal head injuries after being ejected from his vehicle. The police report notes the SUV driver was unlicensed, with a license from Georgia that was not valid in New York. No driver errors beyond 'unspecified' are listed, but the unlicensed status is a critical systemic failure. Helmet use is mentioned only to note its absence, after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when unlicensed drivers operate vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
