Eighteen left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five people died. Four hundred fifty were hurt. The youngest was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent.</p><p>A man stands in a Bushwick crosswalk. A car hits him and throws him fifteen feet. The driver flees. Ruari Fay-Handebeaux wakes up in the hospital, bones shattered. &ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>he says</a>.

They can crack down on drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hit. But the blood keeps coming. The numbers do not budge. <strong>862 crashes in the last year.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-silence>Leadership: Action or Silence?</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They pass laws. But the streets do not change fast enough. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. Each day of delay is another risk. Each day of silence is another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-fight-is-not-over>What Next? The Fight Is Not Over</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by those in power.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand more enforcement. Demand justice for the dead and the living.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He struck pedestrian Katherine Harris, 31, killing her instantly, then rear-ended another car and crashed into an outdoor dining shed. Trujillo's blood alcohol level was .17, more than twice the legal limit.
