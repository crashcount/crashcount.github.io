He never made it. The driver kept going. Police found the man dead in the street.

The point of impact was the left front bumper of the Buick against the left rear bumper of the parked Toyota. The report cites 'Driver Inexperience' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The young driver sustained an abrasion injury to his elbow, lower arm, and hand but was conscious and not ejected. Vehicle damage was limited to the left front bumper of the moving car and the left rear bumper of the parked vehicle.
