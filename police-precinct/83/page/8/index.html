Eighteen left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five people died. Four hundred fifty were hurt. The youngest was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent.</p><p>A man stands in a Bushwick crosswalk. A car hits him and throws him fifteen feet. The driver flees.

The numbers do not budge. <strong>862 crashes in the last year.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-silence>Leadership: Action or Silence?</h3><p>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero. They pass laws. But the streets do not change fast enough. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. Each day of delay is another risk. Each day of silence is another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-fight-is-not-over>What Next? The Fight Is Not Over</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by those in power.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand more enforcement. Demand justice for the dead and the living.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Flesh and steel collided in Brooklyn’s morning heat.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a taxi traveling south on Wilson Avenue struck an eastbound e-scooter at the corner of Greene and Wilson in Brooklyn at 11:02 a.m. The report states, 'A taxi struck an eastbound e-scooter. The rider, 42, helmeted, was thrown and crushed.' The e-scooter rider suffered crush injuries to the entire body and was ejected from the vehicle but remained conscious. The police report explicitly lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, indicating the taxi driver failed to obey traffic signals. The narrative underscores that 'signals [were] ignored.' The e-scooter rider was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause cited is the taxi driver’s disregard for traffic control. The crash left the scooter folded and the cab’s front quarter crumpled, marking another instance where systemic driver error endangered a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
