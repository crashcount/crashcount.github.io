Eight people are dead. Seventeen more are left with serious injuries. Over a thousand have been hurt since 2022. The toll is steady, merciless. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it. In the last twelve months alone, three people died and six suffered life-altering injuries. The dead are not just numbers. A 55-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV on Fulton Street. A 38-year-old man, killed at North Oxford and Flushing. The details are spare, but the loss is total. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They are the weapon in 146 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses follow, then motorcycles and mopeds. Bikes hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras, lower limits, new laws. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The police have the power to enforce speed, to ticket reckless drivers, to watch the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><p>Every crash is preventable. As one official <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>noted</a> after a double fatality, &ldquo;There have been at least 98 traffic deaths citywide this year, down from 135 by the same point last year.&rdquo; The numbers drop, but the dead remain. Another voice, from a family left behind: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate.

A driver sped through a red. The city knew the danger. The mayor stalled safety plans. The street stays deadly. The toll mounts. The fix waits.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-07-17) reports Mayor Adams delayed a redesign of Brooklyn's Third Avenue, long known as hazardous. Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane, shielded by parked cars, now waits for a court fight. Cyclists and advocates hold their ground.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on July 15, 2025, that an appellate judge blocked New York City from removing the protected Bedford Ave bike lane in Williamsburg. The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.' The protected lane, installed in October 2024, separates cyclists from moving vehicles. The ruling highlights ongoing policy battles over street design and cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
