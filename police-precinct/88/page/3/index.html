Eight people are dead. Seventeen more are left with serious injuries. Over a thousand have been hurt since 2022. The toll is steady, merciless. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it. In the last twelve months alone, three people died and six suffered life-altering injuries. The dead are not just numbers. A 55-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV on Fulton Street. A 38-year-old man, killed at North Oxford and Flushing. The details are spare, but the loss is total. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They are the weapon in 146 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses follow, then motorcycles and mopeds. Bikes hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras, lower limits, new laws. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The police have the power to enforce speed, to ticket reckless drivers, to watch the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><p>Every crash is preventable. As one official <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>noted</a> after a double fatality, &ldquo;There have been at least 98 traffic deaths citywide this year, down from 135 by the same point last year.&rdquo; The numbers drop, but the dead remain. Another voice, from a family left behind: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The police in Precinct 88 can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. Local leaders can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and demand enforcement. Residents can call, write, and show up until the killing stops.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Demand action now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan includes boarding islands for safer passenger access and removes two car lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.” The redesign aims to separate buses from car traffic, reduce conflicts, and improve safety for vulnerable road users. Parking will decrease, but the exact impact is unclear. The plan responds to chronic congestion and slow bus speeds, which often fall below five miles per hour during rush hour.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains until streets change.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on May 12, 2025, that the city will redesign Conduit Avenue, a three-mile stretch in Brooklyn and Queens where 'more than 40 serious injuries and five deaths' have occurred in five years. The corridor lacks basic pedestrian infrastructure and has 'long stretches without signalized crossings,' which encourages highway-speed driving through residential areas. The Department of Transportation is launching community workshops and an online feedback map to gather public input. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Brooklyn and Queens Residents deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk.' The redesign aims to address systemic dangers and create safer, more connected streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
