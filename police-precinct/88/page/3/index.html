Eight people are dead. Seventeen more are left with serious injuries. Over a thousand have been hurt since 2022. The toll is steady, merciless. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it. In the last twelve months alone, three people died and six suffered life-altering injuries. The dead are not just numbers. A 55-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV on Fulton Street. A 38-year-old man, killed at North Oxford and Flushing. The details are spare, but the loss is total. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They are the weapon in 146 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses follow, then motorcycles and mopeds. Bikes hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras, lower limits, new laws. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The police have the power to enforce speed, to ticket reckless drivers, to watch the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><p>Every crash is preventable. As one official <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>noted</a> after a double fatality, &ldquo;There have been at least 98 traffic deaths citywide this year, down from 135 by the same point last year.&rdquo; The numbers drop, but the dead remain. Another voice, from a family left behind: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The police in Precinct 88 can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. Local leaders can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and demand enforcement. Residents can call, write, and show up until the killing stops.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Demand action now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

She stepped out to confront the driver. The driver ran her down and fled. Cifuni, twelve weeks pregnant, died on the street. Police arrested the suspect weeks later.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on June 18, 2025, that Chaquasia Pigford was arrested for killing Tiffany Cifuni in a Brooklyn hit-and-run. Pigford, driving a stolen Chevy Trax, rear-ended Cifuni’s Toyota late at night on May 24. When Cifuni, pregnant and 32, exited her vehicle to exchange information, Pigford sped off. Cifuni followed for two blocks, confronted Pigford, and was then run over. Prosecutors described the incident in court, noting Pigford refused to engage before fleeing. The article quotes Cifuni’s family and Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'Pigford was driving a stolen 2016 Chevy Trax... when she rear-ended Cifuni’s 2021 Toyota 4Runner.' The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run drivers and the dangers posed by stolen vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
