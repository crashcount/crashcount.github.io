A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. Police said it was the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week. Witnesses <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>told police the driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping</a>.</p><p>A woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue.

They have not done it yet. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders. They can target the corners where people die. They can act. But action is rare, and silence is easy.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member.
