Eight people are dead. Seventeen more are left with serious injuries. Over a thousand have been hurt since 2022. The toll is steady, merciless. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it. In the last twelve months alone, three people died and six suffered life-altering injuries. The dead are not just numbers. A 55-year-old woman, crushed by an SUV on Fulton Street. A 38-year-old man, killed at North Oxford and Flushing. The details are spare, but the loss is total. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They are the weapon in 146 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses follow, then motorcycles and mopeds. Bikes hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras, lower limits, new laws. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not. The police have the power to enforce speed, to ticket reckless drivers, to watch the corners where people die. They just need to act.</p><p>Every crash is preventable. As one official <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>noted</a> after a double fatality, &ldquo;There have been at least 98 traffic deaths citywide this year, down from 135 by the same point last year.&rdquo; The numbers drop, but the dead remain. Another voice, from a family left behind: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. The police in Precinct 88 can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. Local leaders can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and demand enforcement. Residents can call, write, and show up until the killing stops.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Demand action now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2024 Chevrolet sedan, driven by a licensed male driver from New Jersey, made a left turn and struck her with the vehicle's left front bumper. The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor for the crash. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to her hip and upper leg, and was in shock following the impact. The sedan showed no damage. The driver’s failure to yield during the left turn directly led to the collision, highlighting a critical lapse in driver responsibility at this intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
