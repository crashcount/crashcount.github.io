A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. Police said it was the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week. Witnesses <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>told police the driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping</a>.</p><p>A woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue.

The investigation drags on. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>First responders transported the victim to New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, where she was pronounced dead</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people died and five suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>285 were hurt.</strong> The numbers do not stop.

The city counts the broken.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. The law lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders. They can target the corners where people die. They can act. But action is rare, and silence is easy.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to enforce the law.

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when a 2024 Chevrolet sedan, driven by a licensed male driver from New Jersey, made a left turn and struck her with the vehicle's left front bumper. The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor for the crash. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to her hip and upper leg, and was in shock following the impact. The sedan showed no damage. The driver’s failure to yield during the left turn directly led to the collision, highlighting a critical lapse in driver responsibility at this intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
