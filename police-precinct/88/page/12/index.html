A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. Police said it was the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week. Witnesses <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>told police the driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping</a>.</p><p>A woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue. Another car struck her. She died before morning. Both drivers stayed. No arrests. The investigation drags on. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>First responders transported the victim to New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, where she was pronounced dead</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people died and five suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. <strong>285 were hurt.</strong> The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs hit the hardest. In three years, SUVs caused <strong>2 pedestrian deaths and 21 injuries</strong>. Sedans, motorcycles, trucks, bikes—they all draw blood. But the big cars do most of the killing. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. The law lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it yet. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders. They can target the corners where people die. They can act. But action is rare, and silence is easy.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to enforce the law. Tell them to stop the killing. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
