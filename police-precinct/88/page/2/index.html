Eight people killed. Seventeen left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt. Since 2022, there have been nearly 2,000 crashes here. The dead do not get second chances. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>A woman, age 55, was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. She died on the street. No warning, no time to run. The data says only this: crush injuries, apparent death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They killed two, seriously injured three, and left 137 more with lesser wounds. Trucks and buses hit sixteen. Motorcycles and mopeds, six. Bikes, eighteen. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target the corners where blood stains the crosswalk. But too often, the work is left undone. The dead pile up. The living wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has new laws. Speed cameras run day and night. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. But change comes slow. The street stays dangerous. The council member’s phone rings. The mayor’s office gets another email. Still, the crashes come.</p><p>“He didn’t stop. He just kept going,” said Henry Tziquin, whose father was killed by a hit-and-run driver in Brooklyn. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>NY Daily News</a> The words hang in the air. The driver fled. The family waits for justice.</p><p>Another man, 36, was killed crossing near Broadway Junction. The driver sped off. “The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders, by police, by all of us who look away. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Tell the precinct to crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p>The dead cannot speak. You can.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will fine violators $650 per incident, using in-road sensors to detect excess weight. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price through expensive repairs to our infrastructure." The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles. Albany has approved expanding this automated system to more city roadways. The BQE’s aging structure faces risk from trucks exceeding its design limits, raising safety and infrastructure concerns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists called the move "unwise and unsafe." The article notes the city had previously identified this stretch as among the most dangerous. Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s Streets Master Plan, which mandates more protected lanes, remains unmet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A child was hit weeks before. Injuries on e-bikes outnumber pedal bikes. Officials call it an emergency. The rule moves fast. Riders and workers face new limits.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 5, 2025, that Mayor Adams ordered Citi Bike to limit e-bike speeds to 15 mph, citing an 'emergency threat to life and property.' The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule. The move highlights rising e-bike use and the city’s struggle to manage micromobility safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
