Eight people killed. Seventeen left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt. Since 2022, there have been nearly 2,000 crashes here. The dead do not get second chances. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>A woman, age 55, was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. She died on the street. No warning, no time to run. The data says only this: crush injuries, apparent death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They killed two, seriously injured three, and left 137 more with lesser wounds. Trucks and buses hit sixteen. Motorcycles and mopeds, six. Bikes, eighteen. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target the corners where blood stains the crosswalk. But too often, the work is left undone. The dead pile up. The living wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has new laws. Speed cameras run day and night. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. But change comes slow. The street stays dangerous. The council member’s phone rings. The mayor’s office gets another email. Still, the crashes come.</p><p>“He didn’t stop. He just kept going,” said Henry Tziquin, whose father was killed by a hit-and-run driver in Brooklyn. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>NY Daily News</a> The words hang in the air. The driver fled. The family waits for justice.</p><p>Another man, 36, was killed crossing near Broadway Junction. The driver sped off. “The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders, by police, by all of us who look away. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Tell the precinct to crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p>The dead cannot speak. You can.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The threat of cars remains.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 11, 2025, that parents at Public School 110 in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, are calling for a Paris-style school street to protect children. Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal. The article highlights the persistent risk from drivers using local streets as shortcuts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety, not speed, takes the street.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-06) reports the Department of Transportation will install a protected bike lane on Brooklyn’s Court Street, a corridor plagued by double parking and sideswipe crashes. DOT’s Chris Brunson said, “The narrower street width for vehicles will de-incentivize double parking on the corridor.” The redesign removes a travel lane, adds a protected bike lane, and aims to curb driver behavior that leads to crashes. Between 2022 and 2024, 165 crashes on this mile-long stretch caused one death and injured 15 cyclists and 23 pedestrians. Most pedestrian injuries happened while crossing with the light, showing drivers failed to yield. The plan targets excess road capacity and prioritizes vulnerable users on a Vision Zero Priority Corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, "The suspect was somehow able to drive off the lot with the operator on board, making it down the block to 25th and Cropsey avenues, where he crashed into a parked car." No injuries were reported. Police took the man into custody at the scene. The incident highlights a lapse in depot security, as the intruder was known to frequent the area and accessed the bus before the route began.
