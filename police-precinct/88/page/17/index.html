Eight people killed. Seventeen left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt. Since 2022, there have been nearly 2,000 crashes here. The dead do not get second chances. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>A woman, age 55, was crushed by an SUV at Fulton and Washington. She died on the street. No warning, no time to run. The data says only this: crush injuries, apparent death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They killed two, seriously injured three, and left 137 more with lesser wounds. Trucks and buses hit sixteen. Motorcycles and mopeds, six. Bikes, eighteen. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target the corners where blood stains the crosswalk. But too often, the work is left undone. The dead pile up. The living wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has new laws. Speed cameras run day and night. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. But change comes slow. The street stays dangerous. The council member’s phone rings. The mayor’s office gets another email. Still, the crashes come.</p><p>“He didn’t stop. He just kept going,” said Henry Tziquin, whose father was killed by a hit-and-run driver in Brooklyn. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>NY Daily News</a> The words hang in the air. The driver fled. The family waits for justice.</p><p>Another man, 36, was killed crossing near Broadway Junction. The driver sped off. “The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders, by police, by all of us who look away. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Tell the precinct to crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p>The dead cannot speak. You can.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
