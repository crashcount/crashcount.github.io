A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. Police said it was the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week. Witnesses <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>told police the driver of the Ford Explorer sped off without stopping</a>.</p><p>A woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue.

They have not done it yet. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders. They can target the corners where people die. They can act. But action is rare, and silence is easy.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member.

The bicyclist, a 17-year-old male wearing a helmet, was partially ejected and sustained abrasions and upper arm injuries. The report cites the contributing factor as 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' by the sedan driver. The sedan, a 2019 Dodge, had damage to its left side doors, while the bike was struck on its left front bumper. The bicyclist was conscious after the crash and suffered injury severity level 3.

The crash caused significant front-end damage to both vehicles.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, at 8:28 p.m. on Waverly Avenue in Brooklyn, a 2019 taxi was making a left turn when it collided with a 2021 motorcycle traveling straight eastbound. The point of impact was the taxi’s right front bumper and the motorcycle’s center front end. The motorcycle had one occupant, the driver, while the taxi carried two occupants. The injured party was the 21-year-old female passenger seated on the motorcycle’s right rear or sidecar position. She was conscious but suffered neck injuries and whiplash. The report lists the passenger’s injury severity as moderate (level 3). Both drivers held valid New York licenses. The taxi driver’s maneuver of making a left turn into the motorcycle’s path indicates a failure to yield right of way, a critical driver error leading to the collision.
