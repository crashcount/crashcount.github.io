The lane, installed in October, had reduced crashes, according to DOT data. Plaintiffs argued removal would increase danger and violated city rules on public notice. The city’s lawyers dismissed its own safety data, claiming it was unreliable. Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives warned, “Mayor Adams is exposing the City of New York...to significant financial and legal liability.” Attorney Peter Beadle urged Adams to let DOT implement safer alternatives. The decision highlights how political pressure can override proven safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver was arrested, but the crash reignited calls for overdue street redesign. Advocates cite 80 deaths or serious injuries since 2018 along the corridor. Officials note years of stalled plans: “We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it’s now 2025. What is going on?” said Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes. Residents highlight speeding off highway ramps and poor lighting as persistent dangers.

The fight over safety and street space continues. Cyclists and pedestrians wait as legal battles stall change.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on July 15, 2025, that an appellate judge halted Mayor Adams’s plan to remove a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan. The case underscores how political pressure and lax enforcement can threaten vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
