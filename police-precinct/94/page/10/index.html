Nineteen seriously injured.</strong> Over 1,100 hurt since 2022. The dead include a child crushed by a dump truck at an intersection, a man killed by an e-bike, a woman struck crossing with the light. The stories change. The outcome does not.</p><p>Just this March, a 49-year-old man was killed by an e-bike on India Street. He bled out on the pavement. No warning, no time to react. Three weeks before, a child was killed by a truck turning left on Withers Street. The boy was crossing with the signal. The truck kept moving. The child did not.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Severe bleeding,&rdquo;</strong> the report reads. <strong>&ldquo;Crush injuries.&rdquo;</strong> No comfort in the words.

They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep dying. They know where the bodies fall. They know who is most at risk.</p><p>But the numbers do not budge. <strong>Four deaths in the last year. Eight serious injuries.</strong> The same corners, the same mistakes. The same silence.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. The city has lowered speed limits in some places. Cameras catch some speeders. But the carnage continues. <strong>&ldquo;As of Thursday, 60 pedestrians had been killed by vehicles across the city this year,&rdquo;</strong> the Daily News <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/18/drivers-charged-brooklyn-fatalities-including-woman-escaped-nazis/>reported</a>.</p><p>After a six-month investigation, police charged a driver who killed a 95-year-old woman with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. <strong>&ldquo;He was charged with two counts of failure to yield in a motor vehicle and failure to exercise due care,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-man-arrested-in-fatal-crash-with-pedestrian-95-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl>said the NYPD</a>.</p><p>But most drivers walk away. Most families do not get justice. The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Precinct 94 can do more.</strong> Enforce the law. Crack down on speeding. Ticket failure to yield. Flood the hotspots. Make it clear: every life matters.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Contact your leaders and demand change.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
