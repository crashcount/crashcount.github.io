Officers from the 75th Precinct gave chase. The driver lost control near East 105th Street and Farragut Road, smashing through a fence and landing the vehicle on the Manhattan-bound L train tracks. Eyewitnesses described the chaos: 'Next thing I know, he was into the fence. Absolutely crazy.' The crash left the Jeep mangled and caused overnight subway delays.
