Ten Dead. Who Pays for Broken Streets?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 21, 2025 <em>(Revised August 30, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Precinct 94: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 21, 2025</h2><h2 id=blood-on-the-crosswalks>Blood on the Crosswalks</h2><p>Just last spring, a dump truck turned left at Withers and Woodpoint. A pedestrian was crossing with the signal. The truck crushed him. He died there, in the intersection. The record says only this: <strong>crush injuries, apparent death</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>A few weeks later, a cyclist was killed by an e-bike on India Street. The city file reads: <strong>severe bleeding, head wound, apparent death</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>10 people have died</strong> in traffic crashes in Precinct 94. <strong>Twenty more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,215 injured, 2,851 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>). The dead do not speak. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-mistakes>The Same Streets, the Same Mistakes</h2><p>The pattern repeats. Trucks turning left. Drivers failing to yield. Bikes and mopeds, cars and SUVs, all part of the toll. The police know the corners. They know the hours. They have the power to enforce the law, to slow the cars, to ticket the reckless. They have not stopped the dying.</p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck by a turning driver. The city had promised a road diet. It never came. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can push for protected bike lanes, safer signals, and lower speed limits. They can demand enforcement at known hotspots. They can hold the police to account. They can act, or they can wait for the next name, the next number.</p><p>After the crash on McGuinness, the city said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thinking of the cyclist and wish them a swift recovery. We will review the details of the crash&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>city statement</a>). The words are soft. The street is hard.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Precinct 94 is bleeding.</strong> The police can enforce the law. The city can build safer streets. The leaders can act. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Barriers force drivers to slow, protect cyclists, and clear sightlines. Seventy-nine crashes last year on Ocean Avenue alone. The city moves slow, but hard edges cut risk where cars once ruled.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 12, 2025, that the Department of Transportation will install hard barriers at six Brooklyn intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states. DOT opposes removing parking without barriers, citing risks of faster, more dangerous turns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
