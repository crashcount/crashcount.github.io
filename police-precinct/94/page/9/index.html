Ten Dead.

A pedestrian was crossing with the signal. The truck crushed him. He died there, in the intersection. The record says only this: <strong>crush injuries, apparent death</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>A few weeks later, a cyclist was killed by an e-bike on India Street. The city file reads: <strong>severe bleeding, head wound, apparent death</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>10 people have died</strong> in traffic crashes in Precinct 94. <strong>Twenty more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,215 injured, 2,851 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>). The dead do not speak. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-mistakes>The Same Streets, the Same Mistakes</h2><p>The pattern repeats. Trucks turning left. Drivers failing to yield. Bikes and mopeds, cars and SUVs, all part of the toll. The police know the corners. They know the hours. They have the power to enforce the law, to slow the cars, to ticket the reckless. They have not stopped the dying.</p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck by a turning driver. The city had promised a road diet. It never came. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can push for protected bike lanes, safer signals, and lower speed limits. They can demand enforcement at known hotspots. They can hold the police to account. They can act, or they can wait for the next name, the next number.</p><p>After the crash on McGuinness, the city said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thinking of the cyclist and wish them a swift recovery. We will review the details of the crash&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>city statement</a>). The words are soft. The street is hard.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Precinct 94 is bleeding.</strong> The police can enforce the law. The city can build safer streets. The leaders can act. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A moped traveling west was struck on its left rear quarter panel by an SUV making a left turn in the same direction. The SUV driver failed to yield the right-of-way, causing the collision. The moped carried two occupants, including a 14-year-old male passenger seated in the middle rear seat, who sustained abrasions and injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The passenger was conscious and not ejected from the vehicle. The moped passenger was wearing a helmet, but the police report identifies no contributing factors from the victim’s behavior. The SUV’s right front quarter panel and right side doors were damaged, confirming the point of impact.

The report states that both the sedan driver and the e-bike operator were 'distracted' at the time of the crash. The impact left the e-bike rider bleeding from the head, though he remained conscious at the scene. The report notes 'severe bleeding' as the primary injury, with no damage to either vehicle. The police explicitly cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both parties. The sedan made contact with its right front bumper. The focus remains on the systemic danger posed by distracted driving, as documented in the official account.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
