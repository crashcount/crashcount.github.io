Ten Dead. Who Pays for Broken Streets?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 21, 2025 <em>(Revised August 30, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Precinct 94: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 21, 2025</h2><h2 id=blood-on-the-crosswalks>Blood on the Crosswalks</h2><p>Just last spring, a dump truck turned left at Withers and Woodpoint. A pedestrian was crossing with the signal. The truck crushed him. He died there, in the intersection. The record says only this: <strong>crush injuries, apparent death</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>A few weeks later, a cyclist was killed by an e-bike on India Street. The city file reads: <strong>severe bleeding, head wound, apparent death</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>10 people have died</strong> in traffic crashes in Precinct 94. <strong>Twenty more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,215 injured, 2,851 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>). The dead do not speak. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-mistakes>The Same Streets, the Same Mistakes</h2><p>The pattern repeats. Trucks turning left. Drivers failing to yield. Bikes and mopeds, cars and SUVs, all part of the toll. The police know the corners. They know the hours. They have the power to enforce the law, to slow the cars, to ticket the reckless. They have not stopped the dying.</p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck by a turning driver. The city had promised a road diet. It never came. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can push for protected bike lanes, safer signals, and lower speed limits. They can demand enforcement at known hotspots. They can hold the police to account. They can act, or they can wait for the next name, the next number.</p><p>After the crash on McGuinness, the city said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thinking of the cyclist and wish them a swift recovery. We will review the details of the crash&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>city statement</a>). The words are soft. The street is hard.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Precinct 94 is bleeding.</strong> The police can enforce the law. The city can build safer streets. The leaders can act. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article reports, "Yarimi, 35, was driving nearly double the speed limit when her Audi allegedly struck an Uber, flipped and mowed down the family." Police say Miriam Yarimi drove with a suspended license, no insurance, and expired registration, and ran a red light. She faces multiple charges, including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The crash also injured an Uber driver and passengers. The case highlights the lethal consequences of unchecked speeding and gaps in enforcement against unlicensed, uninsured drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The system failed to stop the car.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-04-01) reports renewed calls for the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill after a Brooklyn crash killed a mother and two children. The driver, with a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' struck the family as they crossed the street. The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.' The incident highlights gaps in enforcement and the stalled progress of safety legislation meant to curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Saada's 4-year-old son was critically injured. The article notes Yarimi had 'numerous traffic violations and speeding tickets' and was driving with a suspended license. Dashcam footage reportedly captured the impact. Before the crash, Yarimi had posted online about fast cars and described herself as an 'adrenaline junkie.' Her vehicle had over 93 traffic violations, including 20 for speeding. The Post quotes an acquaintance: Yarimi 'always talked about driving fast.'

Advocates, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, called it 'an unconscionable tragedy that Albany can stop from ever happening again.' Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio of Families for Safe Streets urged passage of the Speed Limiters for Repeat Offenders Act, noting, 'We know repeat super speeders are deadly.'
