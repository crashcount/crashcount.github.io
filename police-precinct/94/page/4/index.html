Since 2022, nine people have died in crashes here. Nineteen more suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,177 injured, 2,745 crashes in less than four years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A child crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A man killed by a bike on India Street. A young man thrown from his moped, dead before sunrise on Kingsland Avenue. The street keeps its secrets, but the loss is plain.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Promises</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. They caused three deaths and 114 injuries to pedestrians in this precinct. Motorcycles and mopeds injured eight. Bikes killed two and injured eight more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pattern repeats. A truck turns left. A sedan runs the light. A cyclist is hit, a pedestrian is struck, a family waits for news that never comes. The police report says, &ldquo;failure to yield.&rdquo; The body says more.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-action-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Action, and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can demand lower speed limits, safer street designs, and real enforcement. They can push the precinct to crack down on reckless driving, to ticket speeders, to watch the corners where people die. But too often, action comes after the funeral.</p><p>The police can do more. They can target the hotspots. They can write the tickets. They can make it clear: &ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,a%20vision%20%E2%80%94it%27s%20a%20reality">NYPD Commissioner Tisch</a>). But the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-it-now>What Now: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The precinct can enforce the law. Your council member can push for safer streets. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them you want action, not words. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger.

The aide was hospitalized. Police said, "The NYPD did not arrest or charge the driver." Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn this year. The article notes, "46 senior pedestrians were killed in car crashes across the city last year," according to Transportation Alternatives.

The report states the rider was 'partially ejected' and suffered 'crush injuries' to his leg, remaining conscious at the scene. The police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors in the crash. The motorcycle's point of impact was the left front bumper, colliding with the Jeep's center back end. The rider was wearing a helmet, as documented in the report. No contributing factors are attributed to the Jeep driver. The collision underscores the dangers when driver attention lapses and following distances vanish, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to devastating harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
