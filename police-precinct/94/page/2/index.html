Since 2022, nine people have died in crashes here. Nineteen more suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch: 1,177 injured, 2,745 crashes in less than four years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A child crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A man killed by a bike on India Street. A young man thrown from his moped, dead before sunrise on Kingsland Avenue. The street keeps its secrets, but the loss is plain.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Promises</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. They caused three deaths and 114 injuries to pedestrians in this precinct. Motorcycles and mopeds injured eight. Bikes killed two and injured eight more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pattern repeats. A truck turns left. A sedan runs the light. A cyclist is hit, a pedestrian is struck, a family waits for news that never comes. The police report says, &ldquo;failure to yield.&rdquo; The body says more.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-action-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Action, and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can demand lower speed limits, safer street designs, and real enforcement. They can push the precinct to crack down on reckless driving, to ticket speeders, to watch the corners where people die. But too often, action comes after the funeral.</p><p>The police can do more. They can target the hotspots. They can write the tickets. They can make it clear: &ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,a%20vision%20%E2%80%94it%27s%20a%20reality">NYPD Commissioner Tisch</a>). But the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-it-now>What Now: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The precinct can enforce the law. Your council member can push for safer streets. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them you want action, not words. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bus lanes and pedestrian islands will take their place. Fifty-five killed or badly hurt since 2019. Buses crawl. Pedestrians dodge traffic. The city moves to fix a deadly, clogged corridor.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 4, 2025, that New York City's Department of Transportation plans to overhaul Flatbush Avenue between Livingston Street and Grand Army Plaza. The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
