Ten Dead. Who Pays for Broken Streets?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 21, 2025 <em>(Revised August 30, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Precinct 94: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 21, 2025</h2><h2 id=blood-on-the-crosswalks>Blood on the Crosswalks</h2><p>Just last spring, a dump truck turned left at Withers and Woodpoint. A pedestrian was crossing with the signal. The truck crushed him. He died there, in the intersection. The record says only this: <strong>crush injuries, apparent death</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>A few weeks later, a cyclist was killed by an e-bike on India Street. The city file reads: <strong>severe bleeding, head wound, apparent death</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>Since 2022, <strong>10 people have died</strong> in traffic crashes in Precinct 94. <strong>Twenty more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,215 injured, 2,851 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>). The dead do not speak. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=the-same-streets-the-same-mistakes>The Same Streets, the Same Mistakes</h2><p>The pattern repeats. Trucks turning left. Drivers failing to yield. Bikes and mopeds, cars and SUVs, all part of the toll. The police know the corners. They know the hours. They have the power to enforce the law, to slow the cars, to ticket the reckless. They have not stopped the dying.</p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck by a turning driver. The city had promised a road diet. It never came. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can push for protected bike lanes, safer signals, and lower speed limits. They can demand enforcement at known hotspots. They can hold the police to account. They can act, or they can wait for the next name, the next number.</p><p>After the crash on McGuinness, the city said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thinking of the cyclist and wish them a swift recovery. We will review the details of the crash&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>city statement</a>). The words are soft. The street is hard.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Precinct 94 is bleeding.</strong> The police can enforce the law. The city can build safer streets. The leaders can act. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates say this 'all but guarantees that there will be blood on Eric Adams's hands.' NYPD data showed injuries dropped after the lane’s installation. The city acted after complaints from local leaders. The lane sits on a 'Vision Zero Priority Corridor,' one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous streets. Cyclists and residents called the move political and warned it strips away proven safety.

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city intends to revert to an older, unprotected design after complaints from local residents. Advocates argue the protected lane was installed due to 'years of danger and death,' and that removing it is 'unwarranted, unlawful, reckless.' The lawsuit claims the city failed to conduct required traffic or impact studies before making the change. City Hall says intersections will keep some safety features, but the main stretch will lose its protection. The article highlights persistent double-parking and high injury rates as key dangers.

A cyclist strikes. Bedford Avenue’s protected bike lane will vanish. City listens to complaints, not data. Streets stay dangerous. Cyclists and children caught in the crossfire. Policy shifts, safety left behind.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on June 14, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams will remove three blocks of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn after several crashes, including one involving a child exiting a school bus. The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child. The decision raises questions about how New York responds to vulnerable road users and whether removing infrastructure addresses underlying dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
