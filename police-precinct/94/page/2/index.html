Nine left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last year alone, 286 people were hurt in crashes. The dead include a man struck by a dump truck while crossing Withers Street, a woman killed by a turning pickup on Sutton, and a pedestrian cut down by an e-bike that ran a stop sign. The street does not care who you are. It takes the young, the old, the careful, the distracted.</p><p>A witness stood on India Street and watched a man die. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said Jack Collins</a>. The e-bike rider stayed. The man did not get up. The intersection is known for stop sign runs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>Collins said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks killed three. Bikes killed two. Cars and SUVs injured dozens.</strong> In this precinct, heavy vehicles and fast-moving bikes share narrow streets with people on foot. The police know the hotspots. They know the hours. They have the power to enforce the law. But the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They pass laws. They promise action. But in Precinct 94, the pace is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so here. The police can write tickets for speeding and failure to yield. They can target the corners where people die. They can act now. They do not need to wait for another law.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Call your precinct. Call your council member. Demand speed enforcement. Demand lower limits. Demand that every crash is treated as a crime, not a cost of doing business.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Do not wait for the next name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The man was 'crouched in the street to pick up food' when the northbound truck turned right and hit him, according to NYPD officials. The driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene. No arrests have been made. The NYPD's Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. The article notes this crash followed two other recent fatal collisions in Brooklyn. The incident underscores persistent dangers for pedestrians and ongoing issues with drivers leaving crash scenes. NYPD data shows at least 10 traffic deaths in Brooklyn so far this year, matching last year’s pace.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A dump truck’s left turn ended his life as he crossed with the signal. The street held him, still and broken, beneath the right bumper’s crush.</p><p class=mb3>At the corner of Woodpoint Road and Withers Street in Brooklyn, a dump truck making a left turn struck and killed a baby boy who was crossing the intersection with the signal. According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger. The report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the victim, but the sequence of events centers the dump truck’s left turn and the resulting impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
