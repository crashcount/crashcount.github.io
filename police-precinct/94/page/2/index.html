Nine left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last year alone, 286 people were hurt in crashes. The dead include a man struck by a dump truck while crossing Withers Street, a woman killed by a turning pickup on Sutton, and a pedestrian cut down by an e-bike that ran a stop sign. The street does not care who you are. It takes the young, the old, the careful, the distracted.</p><p>A witness stood on India Street and watched a man die. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said Jack Collins</a>. The e-bike rider stayed. The man did not get up. The intersection is known for stop sign runs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen several people get swiped,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>Collins said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Trucks killed three. Bikes killed two. Cars and SUVs injured dozens.</strong> In this precinct, heavy vehicles and fast-moving bikes share narrow streets with people on foot. The police know the hotspots. They know the hours. They have the power to enforce the law. But the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They pass laws. They promise action. But in Precinct 94, the pace is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph, but has not done so here. The police can write tickets for speeding and failure to yield. They can target the corners where people die. They can act now. They do not need to wait for another law.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Call your precinct. Call your council member. Demand speed enforcement. Demand lower limits. Demand that every crash is treated as a crime, not a cost of doing business.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Do not wait for the next name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Danger lingered at the corner.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on April 25, 2025, that Megan Martin, 30, was arrested three months after fatally striking Janet Henriquez, 57, at Blake Ave. and Pennsylvania Ave. in Brooklyn. The article states, "She was arrested Wednesday following a police investigation, and was charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian, and failure to exercise due care, cops said." Martin hit Henriquez while turning left; Henriquez died later that day. The driver remained at the scene. The charges highlight driver error—failure to yield and lack of due care. The case underscores persistent risks at city intersections and the slow pace of accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
