He does not make it across. A 60-year-old, crushed by an SUV, dies in the street. A 17-year-old, struck by a speeding sedan on Kings Highway, never comes home. A 31-year-old, crossing Avenue N, is hit and killed by another SUV. In three years, six people have died on the roads of Precinct 63. Thirty-four more have been seriously injured. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year alone, 705 people were hurt in crashes here. Three were killed. Nine suffered injuries so grave the scars will not fade. The youngest victims are not numbers. They are sons and daughters, left bleeding on the pavement.</p><h3 id=the-police-power-unused>The Police: Power Unused</h3><p>The police in Precinct 63 have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless drivers. They can stand at the corners where the blood pools and say, not here, not again. But the carnage continues. The city says it is fighting back. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.gov/vision-zero-press-release>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>. But the dead do not see police lights. The injured do not hear sirens until it is too late.</p><h3 id=local-leaders-promises-and-delays>Local Leaders: Promises and Delays</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. The Mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.gov/vision-zero-press-release>NYC.gov Vision Zero data</a>). The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to act. But in Precinct 63, the bodies keep coming. The silence from local leaders is louder than any siren.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is failure. Call your council member. Demand action. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safer crossings. Demand that the police use every tool they have. Do not wait for another child to die. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
