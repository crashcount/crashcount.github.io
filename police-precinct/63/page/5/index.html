Since 2022, <strong>four people are dead</strong> on Precinct 63 streets, with hundreds more hurt, most of them car occupants but walkers take heavy blows too, including <strong>four pedestrian deaths</strong> and 314 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The clock tells a story. Injuries spike after school and into the night — the worst hours run <strong>14:00–22:00</strong>, with deaths logged at 12, 19, 20, 21, and 23 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Unsafe speed shadows the precinct.</p><h3 id=utica-and-flatbush-where-bodies-break>Utica and Flatbush: where bodies break</h3><p>One man, 31, died at <strong>Utica Avenue at Avenue N</strong>. He was a pedestrian, struck outside an intersection. Police data says the SUV driver was unlicensed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4504756</a>). Another pedestrian, a 60‑year‑old man, was killed near <strong>Flatbush Avenue at Hendrickson Place</strong> just before 4 a.m.; two vehicles show damage, a SUV and a parked wood‑chipper truck (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4771642</a>). A 24‑year‑old woman died on <strong>Flatlands Avenue</strong>; the record lists her as crossing outside a crosswalk when a Ford sedan hit her (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4539504</a>). These are lines from forms. They are also lives.</p><p>On <strong>Kings Highway at Avenue M</strong>, a 57‑year‑old driver died after a high‑speed crash involving two sedans; the dataset flags <strong>unsafe speed</strong> and a fatal burn (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4776867</a>). On <strong>Flatbush at Avenue U</strong>, a 30‑year‑old motorcyclist was killed; speed again, this time into the side of a fire apparatus (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4815725</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corridors-that-dont-quit>The corridors that don’t quit</h3><p>The map bleeds at <strong>Utica Avenue</strong> and <strong>Flatbush Avenue</strong>. Utica logs a death and 114 injuries. Flatbush adds 154 injuries. The <strong>Belt Parkway</strong> cuts through with 232 injuries. <strong>Avenue J</strong> and <strong>Avenue K</strong> stack dozens more serious hurts (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – top intersections</a>). The heaviest harm falls on people outside cars: pedestrians see two deaths from sedans and two from SUVs in this period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – causes of pedestrian injuries</a>).</p><p>Speed is the constant. In the precinct roll‑up, “unsafe speed” ties to multiple deaths and injuries. In just the last year, crashes are up more than 30% compared to last year‑to‑date, with injuries up more than 50% and serious injuries up 60% (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Period Stats</a>).</p><h3 id=night-falls-the-sirens-rise>Night falls; the sirens rise</h3><p>The evening hours cut deep. Injuries climb after school release and stay high into late night. Deaths land at noon, then again from <strong>7 p.m. through 11 p.m.</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>). People still wait at the same corners. Utica. Flatbush. The Belt. The pattern holds.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-here>What would stop the bleeding here?</h3><p>Start with the hotspots. Daylight the corners on <strong>Utica</strong> and <strong>Flatbush</strong>. Add hardened left turns and leading pedestrian intervals at the worst crossings. Narrow the lanes where speeds climb, especially near <strong>Avenue J/K</strong> and the <strong>Belt</strong> frontage. Target repeat speeding and failure‑to‑yield at evening peaks. These fixes match the crash pattern in the city’s own data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Then go citywide. <strong>Lower the default speed to 20 mph</strong>. Advocates have already laid out the path, and the city has the power. Slower traffic saves lives. Call for it, and for technology that stops the worst drivers from speeding again. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong> would require speed‑limiters on cars that rack up violations. Victims’ families know the cost of waiting. Join them and <strong><a href=/take_action/>take one concrete step today</a></strong>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year.

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
