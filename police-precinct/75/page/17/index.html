Fifteen people have died on these streets since 2022. Fifty-four more have been seriously injured. Most never make the news. Their stories end at the curb, in the crosswalk, or on the hood of a car.</p><p>Just last month, a 21-year-old was killed by a sedan while crossing at Gateway Drive. The driver was distracted and speeding. The crash report lists the cause as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo;</a>. There is no comfort in the paperwork. Only a name, a time, and a body.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h2><p>The violence is not random. SUVs and cars are the main killers—eight deaths, over 700 injuries. Trucks and buses add more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes leave their own scars. The victims are young and old. Some are children. Some are just trying to get home.</p><p>The police know where it happens. They know the corners and the hours. They have the power to act. They can enforce the speed limit. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at the places where people die and say, Not here. Not again.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have the tools. The city can lower speed limits. The precinct can crack down on reckless driving. But the bodies keep coming. The numbers rise. The silence is heavy.</p><p><a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a> The waiting is the policy. The cost is paid in blood.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>This is not fate. This is failure. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where children can cross without fear.

The report details that the e-bike’s front end crumpled on impact, and the pedestrian suffered severe lacerations to her lower leg, remaining conscious at the scene. The police cite 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The e-bike operator was unlicensed and failed to avoid the pedestrian, swerving too late. The report notes the pedestrian was crossing outside the crosswalk, but this is listed after the driver’s errors.
