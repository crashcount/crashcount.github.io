Video shows the Saada family crossing with the light as Yarimi’s Audi 'blasts through the intersection, slamming into the back of the Camry and ramming the mother and her children.' Yarimi’s license was suspended for an insurance lapse. Police are seeking data from her car to confirm speed and braking. No alcohol or drugs were suspected. Yarimi faces charges including manslaughter, reckless driving, and failure to yield.

Police say Yarimi sped through a red light at Ocean Parkway and Quinten Rd., striking Natasha Saada and her three young children as they crossed with the signal. The mother and two daughters died; her son remains hospitalized. Yarimi faces charges including manslaughter, reckless driving, and aggravated unlicensed operation. The article quotes a relative: 'It's a very sensitive time for us, for our community and for our family.'

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
