Both drivers were female; the SUV driver held a permit license.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, at 10:51 AM on Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn, a 2016 Toyota SUV traveling north struck the left rear quarter panel of a 2011 Nissan sedan traveling west. The point of impact was the SUV's right front bumper against the sedan's left rear quarter panel. The collision injured a 91-year-old female occupant seated in the right rear of the sedan, who sustained head injuries and whiplash but was conscious and not ejected. The SUV driver, a female with a permit license, was going straight ahead at the time of the crash. The sedan driver was a licensed female also traveling straight. The report lists unspecified contributing factors but does not attribute fault to the injured passenger. The SUV's failure to avoid rear-ending the sedan reveals a critical driver error, underscoring systemic dangers posed by drivers operating with permit licenses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
