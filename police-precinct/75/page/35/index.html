Fifty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly five thousand hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man crossing Pennsylvania Avenue, the woman struck on Broadway, the child whose leg will never heal. The road does not forgive. The cars do not stop.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. <strong>Seven deaths, 515 minor injuries, 134 moderate injuries, nine left with wounds that will not fade.</strong> Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the weight of the carnage comes on four wheels, not two. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>Just this year, the blood has not stopped. In January, a woman crossing with the light was killed by an SUV making a left turn. In April, a young man died behind the wheel, speed and distraction listed on the report. In June, a child lost a leg. The stories do not change. The faces do.</p><p>Neighbors know the danger. &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>one said</a>. The police know it too. The records show where the bodies fall, which corners bleed most often. The tools are there: tickets for speed, for failing to yield, for running the light. The question is not what can be done. The question is why it is not done.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has new laws. The speed limit can drop. Cameras catch the reckless. But in the end, it is the local hands that matter. The precinct can crack down on speeders. They can stand at the corners where people die. They can make the law mean something. &ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,a%20vision%20%E2%80%94it%27s%20a%20reality">said the NYPD Commissioner</a>.</p><p>But the bodies keep coming. The numbers keep rising. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand redesign. Demand the speed limits that save lives.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. Do not wait for another family to grieve. The road will not change itself. Only people can do that. Only you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
