On Sunday, Aug. 10, a man fell onto the L train tracks at Sutter Ave. in East New York. He was struck by a train and died. “Around 6 p.m., a man fell onto the southbound tracks at the L train station at Sutter Ave. in East New York and was struck by a train,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>police said</a>. “EMS pronounced the victim dead at the scene,” an FDNY <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>spokesman said</a>.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Aug. 5, police described a crash on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn. “Police said both vehicles were heading westbound on Pitkin Avenue, and they were still <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>investigating</a> exactly how the crash unfolded.” “Criminal charges for him were still <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>pending</a> Monday morning.”</p><p>A bad month in 75
On July 27, a collision between a moped and a sedan at Jamaica Ave and Richmond St left one person dead, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>. Two weeks earlier, July 13 near Gateway Dr, a 21-year-old pedestrian was killed; contributing factors included driver inattention and unsafe speed, according to the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>. On July 3 at Broadway and E. New York Ave, a 36-year-old pedestrian was struck and killed at the intersection, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>.</p><p>The pattern
In the last 12 months in Precinct 75: 8 people killed, 1,780 injured, 23 seriously hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>). This year to date: 6 deaths vs. 1 by this point last year — a 500% jump (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>same source</a>). Since 2022, 15 dead, 55 serious injuries, 5,335 injured in crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>).</p><p>Who acts, and where
Pitkin. Pennsylvania. Jamaica. The Belt Parkway exits. These are names that repeat in the casualty log we track.</p><p>Precinct 75 has tools. Enforce speed limits. Write failure-to-yield summonses. Run operations at known hotspots after dark and at rush. Use crash reports to set posts. The law already allows it.</p><p>Elected officials can back redesigns and funding. They can press agencies to fix deadly corridors. They can reward enforcement that protects people on foot and on bikes. They can say, on the record, that delays cost lives.</p><p>Eight dead in a year is not a mystery. It is policy, lane by lane.</p><p>Bold action now. Flood the lines. Demand nightly speed enforcement on Pitkin and Pennsylvania. Demand fixes at Jamaica and Richmond. Demand answers when another person dies and the only witness is chalk on the asphalt.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
