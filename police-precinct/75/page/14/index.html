Both vehicles were fleeing police at the time of the crash. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The e-bike rider, a 31-year-old man, suffered severe neck lacerations and was conscious at the scene. The police narrative describes a violent impact: 'The e-bike rider, 31, strikes hard. No helmet. Neck torn. Blood pools. Doors crumple. Sirens wail.' The sedan sustained damage to its right side doors, while the e-bike impacted the left front bumper. The focus remains on the excessive speed and the peril of high-velocity chases, as detailed in the official account.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
