A burgundy Ford Explorer hits him. The driver does not stop. The man dies at Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. The street is quiet again, but the loss lingers. This is not rare. In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died and 1,426 have been injured</strong> in crashes in Precinct 75 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>). Nineteen of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a heartbeat. Children are not spared. <strong>155 people under 18 were hurt</strong> in the past year. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p>The machines that kill and maim are not mysterious. <strong>SUVs and cars are responsible for six deaths and 129 moderate injuries</strong> to pedestrians here since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>). Trucks and buses add more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. The violence is steady, unyielding. The faces change, the pain repeats. At the corner of Blake Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue, a woman is struck while crossing with the signal. The driver is charged months later. The charge: failure to yield, failure to care. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/24/woman-arrested-in-january-car-crash-that-killed-57-year-old-woman-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;She was arrested Wednesday following a police investigation, and was charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian, and failure to exercise due care, cops said.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But action is not automatic. It comes only when the problem is named. Local leaders speak of studies and redesigns. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-dot-launches-redesign-of-dangerous-conduit-corridor-in-brooklyn-queens>&ldquo;Brooklyn and Queens Residents deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The study is underway. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy. It is enforcement. It is the will to act.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement, failure-to-yield crackdowns, and real protection for people on foot and bike.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop vehicles from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections. The new design will first appear at high-crash sites in Brooklyn, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue and several others. The move highlights a systemic effort to address visibility failures and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
