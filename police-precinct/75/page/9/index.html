On Sunday, Aug. 10, a man fell onto the L train tracks at Sutter Ave. in East New York. He was struck by a train and died. “Around 6 p.m., a man fell onto the southbound tracks at the L train station at Sutter Ave. in East New York and was struck by a train,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>police said</a>. “EMS pronounced the victim dead at the scene,” an FDNY <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>spokesman said</a>.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Aug. 5, police described a crash on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn. “Police said both vehicles were heading westbound on Pitkin Avenue, and they were still <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>investigating</a> exactly how the crash unfolded.” “Criminal charges for him were still <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>pending</a> Monday morning.”</p><p>A bad month in 75
On July 27, a collision between a moped and a sedan at Jamaica Ave and Richmond St left one person dead, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>. Two weeks earlier, July 13 near Gateway Dr, a 21-year-old pedestrian was killed; contributing factors included driver inattention and unsafe speed, according to the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>. On July 3 at Broadway and E. New York Ave, a 36-year-old pedestrian was struck and killed at the intersection, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>.</p><p>The pattern
In the last 12 months in Precinct 75: 8 people killed, 1,780 injured, 23 seriously hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>). This year to date: 6 deaths vs. 1 by this point last year — a 500% jump (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>same source</a>). Since 2022, 15 dead, 55 serious injuries, 5,335 injured in crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>).</p><p>Who acts, and where
Pitkin. Pennsylvania. Jamaica. The Belt Parkway exits. These are names that repeat in the casualty log we track.</p><p>Precinct 75 has tools. Enforce speed limits. Write failure-to-yield summonses. Run operations at known hotspots after dark and at rush. Use crash reports to set posts. The law already allows it.</p><p>Elected officials can back redesigns and funding. They can press agencies to fix deadly corridors. They can reward enforcement that protects people on foot and on bikes. They can say, on the record, that delays cost lives.</p><p>Eight dead in a year is not a mystery. It is policy, lane by lane.</p><p>Bold action now. Flood the lines. Demand nightly speed enforcement on Pitkin and Pennsylvania. Demand fixes at Jamaica and Richmond. Demand answers when another person dies and the only witness is chalk on the asphalt.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Metal tore. Three people hurt. Backs and shoulders slammed. Police cite traffic control ignored. Streets stained by driver error.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, two sedans collided at 17:20 on Liberty Avenue in Brooklyn. Both vehicles were going straight before impact. Three occupants—a 27-year-old man, a 31-year-old man, and a 64-year-old woman—were injured. All suffered abrasions and trauma to the back or shoulder. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the contributing factor, pointing to driver failure to obey signals or signs. No victim actions contributed. The crash left deep damage on the left side doors and front ends, marking the force of the collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
