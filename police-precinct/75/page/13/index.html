Fifty-one seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the toll in Precinct 75 since 2022. Nearly five thousand injured. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors—the empty seat at dinner, the voice that doesn’t answer.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> Seven deaths, 515 minor injuries, 134 moderate, nine serious. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Bikes and mopeds are in the single digits.

This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice—by drivers, by leaders, by those who look away. Call your council member. Demand enforcement. Demand lower speed limits.
