On Feb 16, 2025, a 41‑year‑old driver died on the eastbound Belt Parkway. The record lists <strong>unsafe speed</strong> on <strong>slippery pavement</strong>; the SUV was “demolished.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The dataset records it</a>.

Two weeks later, around 12:30 AM on Jul 13, 2025, a <strong>21‑year‑old</strong> outside the roadway near 395 Gateway Dr was hit by a 2023 sedan. The log cites <strong>driver distraction</strong> and <strong>unsafe speed</strong>; he died where he fell. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The entry is here</a>.</p><p>Since 2022, SUVs and sedans lead the body count for pedestrians here.

The Belt Parkway again. One Sutter Avenue block shows eight serious injuries in this span. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Each is listed in the top locations</a>.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the wreckage</h3><p>The city’s own labels point to the same causes: “other” leads the harm, but the named culprits are there—<strong>failure to yield</strong>, <strong>aggressive driving</strong>, <strong>distraction</strong>, and <strong>unsafe speed</strong>. Together they leave a long trail: 1,575 injuries and 16 deaths across these factors in the precinct’s span. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The contributing factors table lists them</a>.</p><p>In the last 12 months, deaths in this precinct climbed to eight. This year to date, deaths are already six, up from one at this point last year. Injuries are up, too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The period stats confirm the rise</a>.</p><h3 id=what-the-precinct-can-do-now>What the precinct can do now</h3><p>Target the worst blocks first: <strong>Pennsylvania Ave</strong>, <strong>Linden Blvd</strong>, and the <strong>Belt Parkway</strong> ramps. Use hard turns and daylighting to cut blind spots. Post and hold <strong>leading pedestrian intervals</strong> at the busy crossings. Post officers at the known evening peaks. Focus on left turns and yielding.</p><p>Go after speed at the hours that kill. Aim enforcement at repeat behavior, not random stops. Center heavy‑vehicle routes off the blocks with serious injuries.</p><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-stop-the-bleed>Citywide moves that stop the bleed</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. New York now has the power to drop limits. A citywide <strong>20 MPH</strong> default on local streets would cut death at the source. Sammy’s Law made that possible. We need leaders to use it. <a href=/take_action/>Our action guide explains how to push them</a>.</p><p>The worst repeat speeders drive the numbers. One bill would require cars with a streak of tickets or points to use <strong>speed limiters</strong> that keep them within 5 MPH of the limit. Families are already burying loved ones. We don’t need another case to prove it. <a href=/take_action/>Learn how to demand the mandate</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
