Grand Central Parkway adds one death and 260 injuries. These are not streets. They are cuts through the precinct.</li></ul><p>On July 24, 2025, a 24-year-old motorcyclist died on the LIE during a westbound chain of movements that included a lane change and contact with an SUV and tractor trailer, per the city record (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4830329</a>).</p><h3 id=the-avenues-are-not-safe>The avenues are not safe</h3><p>Roosevelt Avenue ranks high for harm: one death, 106 injured. Broadway: one death, 49 injured. Both sit in the top local corridors for trauma since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 70-year-old man was killed by a bus at Hoffman Drive off Woodhaven Blvd on Jun 13, 2025.

The most injuries stack up around school let-out and the commute. About <strong>3 PM</strong> sees a local spike, with 201 injuries and three serious injuries; <strong>2 PM</strong> and <strong>4 PM</strong> are close behind. Night does not spare us: just after <strong>10 PM</strong> and towards midnight, deaths appear across the hours (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly profile</a>).</p><p>Most-listed contributing factors in local deaths and injuries include “other,” driver inattention/distraction, and alcohol involvement. Failure to yield appears in the injury rolls too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-precincts-job-the-citys-duty>The precinct’s job, the city’s duty</h3><p>Precinct 110 officers know the map. The <strong>LIE</strong>, <strong>Grand Central Pkwy</strong>, <strong>Roosevelt</strong>, and <strong>Broadway</strong> are repeat hotspots. Targeted speed enforcement and failure-to-yield crackdowns on those corridors would meet the moment. Daylight the corners. Add hardened turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals at signals. Keep trucks in lanes designed to hold them. The hours around 2–4 PM and late night need a presence. The data says where and when.</p><p>Citywide, the tools exist. Albany renewed New York City’s 24-hour school-zone speed-camera program through 2030. That buys time but not absolution; our own published guidance is blunt: cameras save lives, but lower speeds save more. <strong>Use the new authority to set safer limits and tame repeat offenders</strong> (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><blockquote><p>“Speed kills. You know it. Albany knows it. The city knows it too, yet here we are again—waiting.” (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph.” (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>)</p></blockquote><p>One more lever is on the table. The proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would put speed limiters on cars driven by the worst repeat offenders. Our call is simple: pass it, and make the streets breathe again (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><h3 id=what-breaks-a-heart-is-small>What breaks a heart is small</h3><p>On Aug 13, 2025, two men buying food on a Queens sidewalk were killed when a car jumped the curb. The driver also died. Police told reporters the man had been advised not to drive after a stroke two weeks earlier.
