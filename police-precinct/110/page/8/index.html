The bicyclist, a 32-year-old woman, was ejected from her bike and sustained head injuries classified as severity level 3, including abrasions. The taxi, driven by a licensed male driver, struck the cyclist on its right front quarter panel while both vehicles were going straight ahead. The report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor twice, indicating lapses in focus by the drivers involved. The bicyclist's own contributing factor is noted as 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion,' but the primary cause centers on driver errors. No safety equipment use was recorded. The collision's impact and injuries underscore the dangers posed by distracted driving on busy roadways like the Van Wyck Expressway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
