A truck making a right turn. She never made it to the other side. A 78-year-old, struck by a moped at Grand Avenue and 80th Street, her hip shattered. A 41-year-old man, crushed on the Van Wyck, his body broken by a passing SUV. In three and a half years, <strong>13 people have died</strong> in crashes in Precinct 110. <strong>Twenty-four more suffered serious injuries</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> Of the pedestrians killed or seriously hurt, SUVs were involved in at least three deaths and four serious injuries. Trucks took another life. Mopeds, bikes, and sedans all left bodies and broken bones behind. No helmet, no crosswalk, no right-of-way could save them. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable lose.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>City Hall talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the city has not pulled the trigger. <strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% where installed. Injuries drop 14%.</strong> But the law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Each delay is a gamble with someone else’s life.</p><p>Police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. But it takes will. It takes seeing the dead and injured as neighbors, not numbers.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p>After a firefighter killed a young worker in Queens, prosecutors said, <strong>&ldquo;The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/28/fdny-terminates-michael-pena-firefighter-busted-in-fatal-booze-fueled-queens-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). The driver was drunk, high, and speeding. The city fired him. The family buried their son. The street stayed the same.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand police crack down on reckless driving. <strong>Don’t wait for another body in the road.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
