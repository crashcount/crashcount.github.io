Since Jan 1, 2022, the 110th Precinct has recorded <strong>4,957 crashes</strong>, <strong>2,790 injuries</strong>, and <strong>17 deaths</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Pedestrians account for 9 of those deaths; one person on a bike was also killed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>This Week</p><ul><li>Aug 23: pedestrian killed by a driver on United Nations Ave S (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 15: another crash in the precinct was logged by the city’s database (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=where-the-pain-clusters>Where the pain clusters</h3><p>Police list repeat hotspots: the Long Island Expressway, Roosevelt Avenue, Grand Central Parkway, Broadway, and 57 Avenue (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Late afternoon is a danger window here; the 3–5 PM hours carry some of the heaviest tolls in injuries and deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The records keep naming the same driver actions: inattention and distraction, failure to yield, and blowing past traffic control. One of those “disregarded traffic control” cases ended in death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>). Among pedestrians hurt here during this period, police tie 5 deaths to drivers of cars or SUVs, 2 to truck or bus drivers, and one each to a person on a bike and a moped (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-wont-break-itself>The pattern won’t break itself</h3><p>The past year inside this precinct shows the same stubborn line. In the last 12 months, 1,434 crashes left 934 people hurt and 7 dead (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Year‑to‑date, crashes are only a touch lower than last year while deaths are up to 5 from 2 over the same span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Speed enforcement matters. As the State Senate has said, “<strong>Speed cameras have cut speeding by over 60%</strong> in locations where installed” (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/senate-protects-new-york-students-and-pedestrians>NYS Senate</a>). The cameras run, but the injuries keep coming here.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-we-already-know>Fix the corners we already know</h3><p>Start with the places that spill blood. On Roosevelt Avenue and Broadway, police records flag failure to yield and turning crashes. Daylighting, hardened right turns, and longer leading pedestrian intervals would slow drivers into crosswalks. On the LIE and Grand Central ramps, tighter geometry and speed control can keep off‑ramps from becoming launch pads. Night and late‑day enforcement at recurring hours — especially around 3–5 PM — would meet risk where it lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-bills-that-could-save-someone-tomorrow>The bills that could save someone tomorrow</h3><p>Citywide steps are on the table. Lowering the default speed and forcing chronic speeders to obey would touch every block. The proposed <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up camera or points thresholds — a device that keeps the car from breaking the posted limit by more than 5 MPH (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>).</p><p>Your local officials here are Council Member Shekar Krishnan, Assembly Member Sam Berger, and State Senator Toby Stavisky. The record provided here does not state whether they back the Stop Super Speeders bill. They can. They should say so on the record (<a href=/council-district/25/>District 25</a>, <a href=/assembly-district/27/>AD 27</a>, <a href=/senate-district/11/>SD 11</a>).</p><p>The man who died on Aug 23 did not get a second chance. We can cut speed now and rein in the worst repeat offenders. Ask your officials to move.
