Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals on Liberty Ave, Lefferts Blvd, and North Conduit’s crossings. Daylight corners and add refuge islands on Rockaway Blvd. Target late-night enforcement at North Conduit and Belt Parkway access, where the deaths and injuries stack up (locations and timing from NYC Open Data precinct rollups).</p><p>Citywide tools can backstop the local fixes. The Stop Super Speeders Act would require drivers with repeat violations to install speed limiters that keep them from speeding, using either 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year as the trigger (details from <a href=/take_action/>our briefing</a>).</p><h3 id=who-moves-first>Who moves first?</h3><p>This is Precinct 106.

Will they back a precinct-wide push on hardened turns, night enforcement at the Belt and North Conduit, and real consequences for repeat speeders? The bill is named. The corners are known.</p><p>One woman was killed doing her job on the shoulder of the Nassau Expressway. A child was hit crossing Rockaway. The next fix is not abstract.

The impact crushed his leg. He stayed conscious as the car sped away, leaving him broken in the street. The driver’s aggression marked the night.</p><p class=mb3>A 2004 Chevy sedan traveling southwest on Centreville Avenue near Rockaway Boulevard struck a 29-year-old man, according to the police report. The pedestrian was not at an intersection when the collision occurred. The report states the man suffered crush injuries to his knee and lower leg but remained conscious at the scene. According to the police report, 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' was cited as the primary contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s left front bumper delivered the blow, and the vehicle sustained no damage. The report notes the driver continued on, leaving the injured man in the roadway. No contributing factors related to the pedestrian’s behavior were listed in the police report. The focus remains on the driver’s aggression and the systemic risk it poses to people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
