Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, 830 people have been injured on the streets of Precinct 106. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age or time of day. A mother, a child, a man on his way to work. The road takes them all.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, struck the divider, and vaulted into oncoming traffic. Six people were left broken, two fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;The driver then struck a gray 2016 CR-V, as well as a red 2022 Hyundai, which were traveling westbound.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/belt-parkway-car-accident-queens-leaves-several-injured/16968309/>ABC7</a>. The NYPD closed the road and sent in their Collision Investigation Squad. &ldquo;It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue.&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>New York Post</a>.</p><p><strong>Every week, the list grows.</strong> A 25-year-old killed on the Belt Parkway in April. A 51-year-old woman struck and killed while walking near Lefferts Boulevard in December. A moped driver, ejected and dead, on Nassau Expressway last fall. The stories change, but the ending is the same.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed three people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, left bodies in the street. No helmet or crosswalk can stop a speeding car. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has new laws. Speed cameras now run day and night. The law allows lower speed limits. But the default is still 25 mph. The city could drop it to 20 mph today. They have not. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, and target the places where people keep getting hurt. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Twelve dead is twelve too many.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell the 106th Precinct to enforce the law. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact killed a 51-year-old woman and left a baby boy with broken legs. Both victims were pedestrians and, as the report states, 'not in the roadway' at the time of the crash. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls. The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

Police cited following too closely and reaction to uninvolved vehicle as key factors in the collision.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred on 109 Avenue involving a 2022 Honda SUV and a 2017 Hyundai sedan, both traveling south. The SUV driver, a 22-year-old male with a permit license, was following too closely and struck the sedan's center back end as it was slowing or stopping. The sedan driver, a 26-year-old female licensed driver, was also slowing or stopping but had to react to an uninvolved vehicle, contributing to the collision. Both drivers were injured: the SUV driver suffered back injuries and whiplash, while the sedan driver sustained contusions to the knee and lower leg. Neither occupant was ejected, and both remained conscious. The report highlights driver errors including following too closely and reaction to uninvolved vehicle as the primary causes, with no contributing victim behaviors noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
