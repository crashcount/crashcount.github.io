Thirty-nine were left with injuries so grave they may never heal. The dead are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. A 52-year-old woman, struck at an intersection by a motorcycle. A 51-year-old woman, crushed on the sidewalk. A child, bleeding at the curb. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-unforgiving-road>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Unforgiving Road</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three.</strong> Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one. The rest are left to limp, to grieve, to wonder why the road is never safe. The latest horror came in April, when a car jumped the curb at Liberty Avenue and Lefferts Boulevard. Nine people were hurt. Four were waiting for the bus. Two were on the bus. Three were in the car. Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-struck-several-people-injured-being-hit-south-richmond-hill/16124727/>said none of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries</a>. But the line between life and death is thin here. The bus stop is not a shelter. The sidewalk is not safe.</p><h3 id=the-response-leadership-and-the-long-wait>The Response: Leadership and the Long Wait</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. New laws. But change is slow. The police can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They can write tickets. They can act. But the street keeps bleeding. The silence from leaders is loud. Every day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more>What Comes Next: Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them the street is not safe until the dying stops. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safer crossings. Demand action, not words. The next victim is already walking.</p><p><strong>Take action now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The SUV struck the rear of a sedan, causing catastrophic damage. The report details that the SUV's driver, a 25-year-old man, was killed in the crash, his body crushed inward despite the deployment of the airbag and use of a lap belt. The sedan, an Acura, was traveling straight ahead when it was hit. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor, highlighting the systemic danger of excessive speed during lane changes. No contributing factors are attributed to the sedan’s driver.

Four vehicles traveling westbound collided in a chain reaction. The report identifies 'Following Too Closely' as the primary contributing factor for multiple drivers. Two drivers, ages 39 and 63, were injured with trauma to their knees, lower legs, feet, elbows, and lower arms. Both were restrained with lap belts and harnesses and were not ejected. The vehicles sustained damage primarily to their center front and center back ends, consistent with rear-end impacts. The report explicitly cites driver error in maintaining unsafe following distances, with no mention of victim fault or pedestrian involvement.
