Forty seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the toll in Precinct 106 since 2022. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, seven people died and 16 suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. <strong>Crashes are not rare here. They are routine.</strong></p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>On July 5th, a BMW lost control on the Belt Parkway. The car hit the median, went airborne, and slammed into two other vehicles. Two people died. Three more were thrown from the car and left broken on the asphalt. The NYPD said, &ldquo;Thompson later succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead, police said.&rdquo; <a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny</a>. The investigation is ongoing. The road is unchanged.</p><p>Just weeks before, a 25-year-old moped rider was killed at 121st Street and 149th Avenue. He was ejected and crushed. No one has been charged. The street is the same.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs caused the most harm: three deaths, over 350 injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt 20 more. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, left others bleeding. Even bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a drop in the flood.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done? What Hasn’t?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk safety. The carnage continues.</strong> The city has new powers to lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the streets in Precinct 106 are still killing fields. Police have the tools: they can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, target crash hotspots. They just need to act.</p><p>A survivor said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>. But caution is not enough.

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact killed a 51-year-old woman and left a baby boy with broken legs. Both victims were pedestrians and, as the report states, 'not in the roadway' at the time of the crash. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls. The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

Police cited following too closely and reaction to uninvolved vehicle as key factors in the collision.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, the crash occurred on 109 Avenue involving a 2022 Honda SUV and a 2017 Hyundai sedan, both traveling south. The SUV driver, a 22-year-old male with a permit license, was following too closely and struck the sedan's center back end as it was slowing or stopping. The sedan driver, a 26-year-old female licensed driver, was also slowing or stopping but had to react to an uninvolved vehicle, contributing to the collision. Both drivers were injured: the SUV driver suffered back injuries and whiplash, while the sedan driver sustained contusions to the knee and lower leg. Neither occupant was ejected, and both remained conscious. The report highlights driver errors including following too closely and reaction to uninvolved vehicle as the primary causes, with no contributing victim behaviors noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
