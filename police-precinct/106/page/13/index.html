Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, the streets of Precinct 106 have run red. The toll: 4,142 crashes, 2,790 injuries, and families left with empty chairs. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, mothers, neighbors. The violence is relentless. It does not pause for holidays or weekends.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-fresh-grief>Recent Crashes, Fresh Grief</h3><p>On July 5, a BMW on the Belt Parkway went airborne, slammed into the barrier, and caught fire. Two died. Three were thrown from the car. Police said, &ldquo;No one in the doomed BMW was wearing a seat belt&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>NY Daily News</a>). A survivor remembered, &ldquo;They went airborne and into the barrier&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>A few months earlier, a 25-year-old man was killed on his motorcycle at 149th Avenue and 121st Street. In December, a woman was struck and killed by a taxi on Lefferts Boulevard. Her child was injured. The street does not forgive mistakes. It punishes them.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> Of the deaths and serious injuries to pedestrians, sedans and SUVs were responsible for the majority. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds killed and maimed, too. Bikes caused two injuries, but no deaths. The danger is not shared equally. The most vulnerable—those on foot, on bikes, the old, the young—pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. They can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. The police can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. But the carnage continues. Each crash is a question: <strong>Who will act? Who will wait?</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Every day of delay is another family shattered.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
