Forty seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the toll in Precinct 106 since 2022. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, seven people died and 16 suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. <strong>Crashes are not rare here. They are routine.</strong></p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>On July 5th, a BMW lost control on the Belt Parkway. The car hit the median, went airborne, and slammed into two other vehicles. Two people died. Three more were thrown from the car and left broken on the asphalt. The NYPD said, &ldquo;Thompson later succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead, police said.&rdquo; <a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny</a>. The investigation is ongoing. The road is unchanged.</p><p>Just weeks before, a 25-year-old moped rider was killed at 121st Street and 149th Avenue. He was ejected and crushed. No one has been charged. The street is the same.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs caused the most harm: three deaths, over 350 injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, hurt 20 more. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, left others bleeding. Even bikes are not blameless, but their toll is a drop in the flood.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done? What Hasn’t?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk safety. The carnage continues.</strong> The city has new powers to lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the streets in Precinct 106 are still killing fields. Police have the tools: they can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, target crash hotspots. They just need to act.</p><p>A survivor said, &ldquo;I have a baby with me.
