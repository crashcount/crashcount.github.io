A car comes the wrong way. The driver does not stop. Antonio Smith-Ortiz, 25, is left dying in the road. The driver flees. Police say, &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked 2015 Ford Transit 350 Courier van before speeding off&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>A cyclist is hit on 115th Avenue. The driver does not stop. Police arrive to find the victim unconscious. &ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>Nine people wait at a bus stop. A car jumps the curb. Metal and glass fly. Four pedestrians, two bus riders, three in the car—all hurt. Police say, &ldquo;none of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-struck-several-people-injured-being-hit-south-richmond-hill/16124727/>ABC7</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, five people have died and sixteen have been seriously injured in crashes here.</strong> The numbers do not heal. They do not bring back the dead.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-106>The Role of Precinct 106</h3><p><strong>Precinct 106 has the power to act.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They can make it clear: these are not accidents. They are choices. They are failures to protect.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). But in these streets, the killing goes on. Laws like Sammy’s Law give the city power to lower speed limits. The city can act. The precinct can act. But action is not words. Action is fewer bodies on the ground.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Precinct 106. Demand speed enforcement. Demand protection for people walking, biking, waiting for the bus.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
