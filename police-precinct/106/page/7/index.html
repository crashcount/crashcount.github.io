The impact killed a 51-year-old woman and left a baby boy with broken legs. Both victims were pedestrians and, as the report states, 'not in the roadway' at the time of the crash. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls. The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.
