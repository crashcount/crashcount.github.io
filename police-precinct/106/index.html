Queens traffic grinds and the danger hums.</p><p class=mb3>Two sedans traveling straight collided at Rockaway Boulevard near Woodhaven Boulevard in Queens. Both drivers were injured with arm wounds and minor bleeding. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” The data lists driver inattention for both vehicles and shows impact to the left front bumpers, consistent with a head-on or angle strike while going straight. No pedestrians or cyclists were reported, but passengers were listed as involved registrants. This crash reads like a failure of focus by both drivers in a high-speed corridor that funnels long lines of cars. The harm fell on people inside the cars. The cause points to distraction behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses. The legal fight spotlights tension between safety improvements and business concerns, as the corridor ranks among Queens' most crash-prone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
