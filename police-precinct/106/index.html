Forty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, 830 people have been injured on the streets of Precinct 106. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age or time of day. A mother, a child, a man on his way to work. The road takes them all.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway, struck the divider, and vaulted into oncoming traffic. Six people were left broken, two fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;The driver then struck a gray 2016 CR-V, as well as a red 2022 Hyundai, which were traveling westbound.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/belt-parkway-car-accident-queens-leaves-several-injured/16968309/>ABC7</a>. The NYPD closed the road and sent in their Collision Investigation Squad. &ldquo;It was unclear what caused the driver to lose control but police said speed may have been an issue.&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>New York Post</a>.</p><p><strong>Every week, the list grows.</strong> A 25-year-old killed on the Belt Parkway in April. A 51-year-old woman struck and killed while walking near Lefferts Boulevard in December. A moped driver, ejected and dead, on Nassau Expressway last fall. The stories change, but the ending is the same.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed three people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, left bodies in the street. No helmet or crosswalk can stop a speeding car. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has new laws. Speed cameras now run day and night. The law allows lower speed limits. But the default is still 25 mph. The city could drop it to 20 mph today. They have not. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless drivers, and target the places where people keep getting hurt. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Twelve dead is twelve too many.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell the 106th Precinct to enforce the law. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

After a crash on the Van Wyck Expressway, Augustin assaulted Jasmer Singh, using slurs and violence. Prosecutors said Augustin yelled, 'No police, no police,' and called Singh 'turban man' before punching him. Singh died from the assault. Police were initially slow to pursue hate crime charges, but a grand jury and community pressure led to a harsher indictment. Augustin pleaded guilty to second-degree assault as a hate crime, avoiding a possible manslaughter conviction.

Ten years of pressure forced change. The fleet stands as the most accessible in the nation. Policy, not luck, drove this. Disabled riders gain ground. Streets shift. Access grows.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 5, 2025, that New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) reached a milestone: 50% of active taxis are now wheelchair accessible. TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift. The article highlights systemic progress, not individual driver actions, and underscores the impact of sustained advocacy and regulatory pressure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
