It comes with the slow grind of wheels on flesh, steel on bone. <strong>Six people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> More than 1,200 have been injured. Thirty-four were hurt so badly they may never walk the same again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 34-year-old man, struck by an SUV at the corner of 7th Avenue and West 36th, died with his whole body broken. The driver was distracted. The man is gone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old woman, riding her bike, was killed by a driver who did not see her. She was hit on West 36th Street. She did not get up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs do the worst damage.</strong> Two deaths by truck. Two by SUV. Cars, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars. But the biggest vehicles leave the deepest wounds.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not stop. In April, a box truck crushed a pedestrian on West 40th Street. In May, a cyclist hit a pedestrian at unsafe speed on West 45th. In July, a van towing a food cart broke loose and slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Firefighters found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was arrested for reckless endangerment. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-arrested-nypd-discovers-75-gallons-gasoline-10-diesel-inside-van-manhattan-nyc/17154624/>&ldquo;The driver was arrested and facing several charges, including reckless endangerment and multiple fire code violations.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A city worker was slashed by a cyclist after a near-collision at Broadway and Cedar. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness said.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Promises, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to enforce the law. But the pace is slow. <strong>Mayor Adams cut protected bike and bus lanes from the Fifth Avenue redesign, leaving cyclists and pedestrians to fight for scraps.</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>&ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; said Community Board 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia.</a></p><p>The police in Precinct 14 have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people keep dying. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell Precinct 14 to enforce the law. Tell them to protect the people who walk and bike. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board voted 31-5 in favor. DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent, helping 28,000 daily riders. Supporters called current buses 'painfully slow' and said, 'Time is life!' Others feared diverted cars would 'flood into narrow residential streets.' The plan would force cars to exit 34th quickly or face tickets.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers.

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
