Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,100 hurt since 2022. Each number is a body on the street, a family changed forever. The dead do not speak. The living limp home, if they make it at all.</p><p>Just last year, a 23-year-old woman was killed riding her e-bike on West 36th Street. A 34-year-old man died crossing 7th Avenue. A box truck crushed a pedestrian on 9th Avenue this April. The pattern is the same: <strong>trucks, SUVs, and cars strike, and people fall</strong>. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h3 id=crashes-keep-coming-leaders-talk>Crashes Keep Coming, Leaders Talk</h3><p>The carnage does not slow.

The ramp was closed for hours. Commuters waited. The street did not change.</p><p>The police can act. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hit. But action is rare. &ldquo;Police said at the time no criminality was suspected,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/nyc-straphanger-fatally-struck-by-manhattan-subway-train/>after a woman was killed by a train at Union Square</a>.

Speed cameras are renewed. But the city moves slow. The council talks. The mayor promises. The dead wait for action.</p><p><strong>Precinct 14 can do more.</strong> The police know the hotspots. They know the hours when crashes spike. They have the power to enforce the law. They need to use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong> Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
