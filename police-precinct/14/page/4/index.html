Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,100 hurt since 2022. Each number is a body on the street, a family changed forever. The dead do not speak. The living limp home, if they make it at all.</p><p>Just last year, a 23-year-old woman was killed riding her e-bike on West 36th Street. A 34-year-old man died crossing 7th Avenue. A box truck crushed a pedestrian on 9th Avenue this April. The pattern is the same: <strong>trucks, SUVs, and cars strike, and people fall</strong>. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h3 id=crashes-keep-coming-leaders-talk>Crashes Keep Coming, Leaders Talk</h3><p>The carnage does not slow.

Speed cameras are renewed. But the city moves slow. The council talks. The mayor promises. The dead wait for action.</p><p><strong>Precinct 14 can do more.</strong> The police know the hotspots. They know the hours when crashes spike. They have the power to enforce the law. They need to use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement.

The pursuit ended when the SUV crashed near Dyckman Street and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV, then drove off without attempting to help the driver or calling an ambulance.' The driver died at the scene, unidentified and burned beyond recognition. The officers failed to report the crash to supervisors and signed off for the day. Both were suspended as the NYPD and Attorney General investigate. The incident follows a recent NYPD policy change that bars pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' The case highlights risks of police pursuits and questions about adherence to new policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cold air hung over the still street.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a box truck parked near 851 Avenue of the Americas suddenly lurched north and struck a 33-year-old man who was behind the wheel of another vehicle. The man, identified as the driver and sole occupant, wore a lap belt and harness but was pronounced dead at the scene. The crash occurred at 8:10 a.m. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical lapse in driver vigilance. The truck, registered in Ohio and operated by a licensed driver from Louisiana, was supposed to be stationary but instead moved forward, causing fatal impact. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction and the dangers posed by large vehicles left unattended on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A cab made a U-turn and struck her. Another car hit her moments later. She was rushed to the hospital. Both drivers stayed. She did not survive.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published February 6, 2025), Frances Rickard, 90, was crossing York Avenue at East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when a yellow taxi, driven by a 68-year-old man, made a U-turn and struck her. Police said, “Moments later, a 35-year-old woman driving a 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer also struck her.” Rickard was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center, where she died. Both drivers remained at the scene and have not been charged. The sequence highlights the dangers of U-turns and multi-lane crossings for pedestrians. The intersection saw two vehicles collide with a vulnerable road user in quick succession, underscoring persistent risks in city street design and driver behavior.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
