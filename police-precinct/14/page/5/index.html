The 65-year-old driver bled from the head. Lap belt held him in. Flesh split.' The SUV driver, a 65-year-old man, suffered severe head lacerations but remained conscious. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' as contributing factors in the crash. The taxi struck the center front end into the SUV’s left rear bumper, both vehicles traveling south. The data points to driver error—specifically inattention and aggression—as the cause of the violent impact.
