It comes with the slow grind of wheels on flesh, steel on bone. <strong>Six people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> More than 1,200 have been injured. Thirty-four were hurt so badly they may never walk the same again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 34-year-old man, struck by an SUV at the corner of 7th Avenue and West 36th, died with his whole body broken. The driver was distracted. The man is gone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A 23-year-old woman, riding her bike, was killed by a driver who did not see her. She was hit on West 36th Street. She did not get up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Trucks and SUVs do the worst damage.</strong> Two deaths by truck. Two by SUV. Cars, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars. But the biggest vehicles leave the deepest wounds.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not stop. In April, a box truck crushed a pedestrian on West 40th Street. In May, a cyclist hit a pedestrian at unsafe speed on West 45th. In July, a van towing a food cart broke loose and slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Firefighters found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was arrested for reckless endangerment. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-arrested-nypd-discovers-75-gallons-gasoline-10-diesel-inside-van-manhattan-nyc/17154624/>&ldquo;The driver was arrested and facing several charges, including reckless endangerment and multiple fire code violations.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A city worker was slashed by a cyclist after a near-collision at Broadway and Cedar. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness said.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Promises, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to enforce the law. But the pace is slow. <strong>Mayor Adams cut protected bike and bus lanes from the Fifth Avenue redesign, leaving cyclists and pedestrians to fight for scraps.</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>&ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; said Community Board 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia.</a></p><p>The police in Precinct 14 have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people keep dying. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-not-excuses>Call to Action: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell Precinct 14 to enforce the law. Tell them to protect the people who walk and bike. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk. Demand action now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
