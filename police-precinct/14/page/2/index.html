Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,100 hurt since 2022. Each number is a body on the street, a family changed forever. The dead do not speak. The living limp home, if they make it at all.</p><p>Just last year, a 23-year-old woman was killed riding her e-bike on West 36th Street. A 34-year-old man died crossing 7th Avenue. A box truck crushed a pedestrian on 9th Avenue this April. The pattern is the same: <strong>trucks, SUVs, and cars strike, and people fall</strong>. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h3 id=crashes-keep-coming-leaders-talk>Crashes Keep Coming, Leaders Talk</h3><p>The carnage does not slow.

The ramp was closed for hours. Commuters waited. The street did not change.</p><p>The police can act. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hit. But action is rare. &ldquo;Police said at the time no criminality was suspected,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/nyc-straphanger-fatally-struck-by-manhattan-subway-train/>after a woman was killed by a train at Union Square</a>.

Speed cameras are renewed. But the city moves slow. The council talks. The mayor promises. The dead wait for action.</p><p><strong>Precinct 14 can do more.</strong> The police know the hotspots. They know the hours when crashes spike. They have the power to enforce the law. They need to use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong> Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.'

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'After seeing tremendous success on 14th Street where buses have sped up, traffic has virtually disappeared, and far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes we are excited to propose a similar design on 34th Street.' The 14th Street busway, launched in 2019, increased bus speeds by up to 24% and reduced crashes.

Policy echoes 14th Street’s busway success.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on May 19, 2025, that New York City plans to restrict most passenger vehicles from 34th Street, Manhattan, between Third and Ninth Avenues. The Department of Transportation aims to allow only buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off quickly. The M34 bus, used by 28,000 daily riders, currently averages just 3 mph during rush hour. Officials cite the 2019 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24% and reduced crash injuries. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks. The move follows previous controversies over similar projects but reflects a push for safer, more efficient streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.'

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

According to the police report, the sedan’s right-side doors were damaged and the cyclist was injured, suffering abrasions to the arm and partial ejection. The report lists 'Other Vehicular' as a contributing factor for both drivers, highlighting a systemic failure rather than a single error. The cyclist was conscious after the crash. No specific driver action, such as failure to yield or distraction, was cited. The police report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor. The incident underscores the risks faced by cyclists sharing space with cars on busy city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The article states, "NYPD sources said the two officers in pursuit returned to their stationhouse without reporting the crash." The FDNY later found Guzman Parra dead in the burning car. Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim." The officers remain on leave as both the NYPD and the New York attorney general's office investigate. The case raises questions about police pursuit protocols and reporting failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
