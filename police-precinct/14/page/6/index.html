The sedan was parked when the crash happened, impacting the left side doors. The bicyclist, traveling westbound, was ejected and sustained fractures and dislocations to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The report cites 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Other Vehicular' factors contributing to the crash, indicating driver error related to limited visibility. The bicyclist was not wearing safety equipment. The driver of the sedan was licensed and operating the vehicle legally, but the obstructed view likely prevented avoiding the collision.

The pedestrian sustained injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot, resulting in minor bleeding and shock. The report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor to the crash. The taxi driver, a licensed male operating a 2015 Toyota, was going straight ahead at the time of impact.
