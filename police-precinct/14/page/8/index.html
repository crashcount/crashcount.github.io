A pedestrian, a 31-year-old male, was injured with fractures and dislocations affecting his entire body. The report identifies a 'Driverless/Runaway Vehicle' as the primary contributing factor, indicating the vehicle was uncontrolled at the time of impact. The pedestrian was not in the roadway, and no contributing factors were attributed to him. The vehicles involved included a parked 2017 Toyota sedan and a stopped 2023 Tesla taxi, both damaged on their front bumpers. The taxi had two occupants and a licensed male driver. The uncontrolled vehicle's failure to remain under control caused the collision, underscoring systemic risks posed by driverless or runaway vehicles in urban traffic environments.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
