A cyclist pedals home. A child waits at the curb. In Precinct 28, the story repeats. <strong>From January 2022 to June 2025, 1,198 crashes tore through these streets.</strong> One person died. <strong>Ten suffered serious injuries.</strong> Six hundred and eight were hurt. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> In the last year alone, two people suffered life-changing injuries: a 67-year-old cyclist, bleeding from the head on West 111th; a 15-year-old boy, thrown from his bike on 125th. A woman, age 33, left in shock after a crash on 125th. The details are sparse. The wounds are not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, taxis, trucks, bikes, and buses—all have drawn blood here.</strong> SUVs and cars led the count, with 36 incidents causing moderate or serious injury. Bikes and motorcycles followed, their riders and those they struck left broken. The street does not care who is at fault. It only takes.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They speak of safer streets, lower speed limits, and more cameras. But in Harlem, the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools—speed cameras, enforcement, street redesign. <strong>The police in Precinct 28 can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield.</strong> They can target crash hotspots. They can write tickets. They can act. But the numbers do not lie. Action is not enough. Not yet.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Every injury is a call for action. <strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them: <strong>Slow the cars. Protect the people. Do it now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
