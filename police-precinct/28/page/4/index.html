The article notes the police are investigating if officers left the scene without reporting the crash. The incident came three months after NYPD restricted car chases for low-level offenses. Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes. The fatal fire highlights the ongoing risks of police pursuits and questions the effectiveness of recent reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
