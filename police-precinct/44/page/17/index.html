The motorcyclist ran the red, hit him, and fled. The boy was left in the road, fighting for his life. Police said, &ldquo;A 15-year-old boy riding his scooter was critically hurt when a Bronx motorcyclist blew through a red light, slammed into him and sped away&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/boy-15-on-scooter-struck-by-hit-and-run-bronx-motorcyclist-critically-hurt/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>Precinct 44 has seen 528 injuries, 1 serious injury, and 1 death</strong>.
