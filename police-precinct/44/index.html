Same ending.</p><p>Police say a 21-year-old in a Mercedes tried to pass on the Bronx River Parkway around 1 a.m., hit a Volkswagen, then struck two bikes. The riders were thrown and died at nearby hospitals: 19-year-old Manuel Amarantepenalo and 21-year-old Enrique Martinez, both from the Bronx. The driver, Mauricio Neyra Yuyes, was arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, according to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> and <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>amNY</a>. A family member at the courthouse asked, “He’s just walking freely? Two people were killed. He was drunk,” reported the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a>.</p><p>The southbound lanes closed near Gun Hill Road. The road reopened. The boys did not. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/2-killed-1-taken-into-custody-in-multivehicle-bronx-river-parkway-crash-nypd-says>Gothamist</a> logged the shutdown. The city moved on.</p><p>Night after night.</p><ul><li>In this precinct, deadly harm clusters in the dark hours: 1 a.m. shows the single worst hour for deaths, with more spikes at 4–5 a.m. and 9 a.m., per city data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>).</li><li>SUVs and sedans hurt most pedestrians here: SUVs in 146 cases, with 3 pedestrian deaths; sedans in 151 cases, with 1 pedestrian death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Open Data</a>).</li><li>The top killers and cripplers by factor roll up as “other” and vulnerable road user error, a fog that hides speed, alcohol, and failure to yield inside a single bucket (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>The map does not lie.</p><ul><li>Two deaths and 63 injuries line <a href=#>Webster Avenue</a> and two more deaths stack on the <a href=#>Cross Bronx Expressway</a>, with more harm on <a href=#>Jerome Avenue</a> and the Major Deegan, per precinct rolls (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>).</li><li>A 75-year-old woman crossing with the signal at Grand Concourse and E. 164th was killed by an unlicensed sedan driver.

One fix.</p><ul><li>Daylight the turns on Webster and Jerome. Harden every left. Give leading pedestrian intervals at Grand Concourse and 164th. These are simple, standard tools.</li><li>On the highways, target the night: recurring enforcement at 1–5 a.m. where deaths spike. Repeat hotspots, repeat presence.</li><li>Keep trucks in their lanes and out of local shortcuts. Mark and enforce truck routes near the Deegan and Cross Bronx.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany renewed 24/7 school-zone speed cameras through 2030, but cameras can’t stop a foot from going down. The city now has the power to drop speeds. Advocates are pushing a default 20 mph and stronger action against the worst repeat drivers. A tiny pool does outsized harm — the repeat offenders who rack tickets and keep driving. The fix is simple: slow all streets and force speed control on cars with a record. The call is on the table. Use it. See our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> guide.</p><p>The family said it plain. “Two people were killed. He was drunk.” That lives here now, on the Parkway, in Precinct 44. It will live here tomorrow unless we cut the speed and close the gap on the worst behind the wheel.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
