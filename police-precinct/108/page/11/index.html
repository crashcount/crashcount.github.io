A 28-year-old cyclist, struck by a turning truck at Greenpoint and 43rd, died with her helmet still on. An 8-year-old girl, riding in the back seat, left the Brooklyn Queens Expressway by ambulance. In three years, <strong>12 people have died</strong> on the streets of Precinct 108. <strong>Thirty-four more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The youngest killed was a child. The oldest, 75. These are families torn open, futures erased.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm</strong>. SUVs and sedans killed four. Trucks and buses left eight with broken bones or worse. Motorcycles and mopeds, five more. Bikes, too, have left their mark. The streets do not forgive. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—they pay first.</p><h3 id=the-response-what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They say, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>said Mayor Adams</a>). Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Precinct 108, the pace of change is slow. Crashes keep coming. The police have the tools: speeding tickets, failure-to-yield, targeting hotspots. They just need to use them.</p><h3 id=the-warning-infrastructure-fails-danger-remains>The Warning: Infrastructure Fails, Danger Remains</h3><p>Even the sky is not safe. In April, a bolt from the No. 7 train crashed through a windshield at Queens Plaza. &ldquo;A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me. Like on my legs, in my legs, on my chest,&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/exclusive-debris-subway-tracks-shattered-mans-windshield-dented-car-queens/16217411/>said Malnick</a>). The MTA promises inspections. The danger hangs above and below.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-actionnow>The Call: Demand Action—Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits, real enforcement, and safer crossings. <strong>Every day of delay is another day for a child to die.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
