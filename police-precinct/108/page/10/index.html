Harden right turns for box trucks on Greenpoint Avenue. Daylight the mouths along Queens Boulevard. Put leading walk signals at 46th Street and 47th Avenue. Treat the BQE frontage like the danger it is: slow entries, better channelization, and barriers that keep speeds down. Focus night enforcement where the deaths cluster.</p><p>Then go bigger. The city has the tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set slower limits. A 20 mph default on local streets would cut the force that breaks bodies. And the state has a bill to stop the worst repeat offenders. Drivers with long records of tickets kill more often. Speed limiters would cap the harm.</p><p>These are not theories.
