Harden right turns for box trucks on Greenpoint Avenue. Daylight the mouths along Queens Boulevard. Put leading walk signals at 46th Street and 47th Avenue. Treat the BQE frontage like the danger it is: slow entries, better channelization, and barriers that keep speeds down. Focus night enforcement where the deaths cluster.</p><p>Then go bigger. The city has the tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set slower limits. A 20 mph default on local streets would cut the force that breaks bodies. And the state has a bill to stop the worst repeat offenders. Drivers with long records of tickets kill more often. Speed limiters would cap the harm.</p><p>These are not theories.

The victim sustained facial contusions and bruises and was conscious at the scene. The report does not list any contributing factors from the pedestrian or the e-scooter driver, nor does it specify driver errors such as failure to yield. However, the collision occurred at night, and the presence of a motorized scooter in pedestrian space underscores systemic risks. No helmet or safety equipment was noted for the pedestrian, but this was not cited as a contributing factor. The incident reflects ongoing dangers of e-scooters operating near vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
