Thirty-five seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the toll in Precinct 108 since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are neighbors, children, elders, cyclists, walkers. They are gone.</p><p>In the last year: two more deaths. Nine more lives changed by serious injury. <strong>Seven hundred twenty-three people hurt.</strong> The pain spreads. It does not stop.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>On June 26, a 16-year-old girl was killed at 47th Avenue and 46th Street. She was crossing at the intersection. A car turned left. She never made it home. The crash report lists her as &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo;—the language of bureaucracy, not grief (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><p>On April 23, a 38-year-old man was killed on Roosevelt Avenue.

But the work is slow. The deaths are fast. Police can enforce speed, ticket reckless drivers, and watch the corners where people die. They can act. They must.</p><p>The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad comes after the fact. They close the road, count the bodies, and move on. As one report <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>put it</a>: &ldquo;The NYPD&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad was probing the wreck, police said.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The precinct can target speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. The council can fund street redesigns. The mayor can demand action. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
