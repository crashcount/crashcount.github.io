A 28-year-old woman, thrown from her bike and killed by a turning truck. An 18-year-old moped rider, ejected and left unconscious. A 75-year-old man, gone in the back seat of a car. In the last twelve months, three people have died in Precinct 108. Nine more suffered serious injuries. The list of the wounded is long: 738 injured, many left with broken bones, torn flesh, or worse. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>Children are not spared. One child killed, 28 more injured. The numbers do not tell you about the shoes left behind, the blood on the curb, the families who wait for a voice that will never come home.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. They killed four, left 52 with moderate injuries, and three with wounds called “serious.” Trucks and buses add eight more to the count. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the weight of steel and speed is what breaks bodies here. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data vehicle breakdown</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can act. But the speed on most streets is still 25 mph. Cameras that catch speeders are proven to save lives, but their future is always in doubt. The police can enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They have the tools. They need only use them.</p><p>When the system fails, the metal falls. In April, debris from the No. 7 train crashed through a windshield at Queens Plaza. &ldquo;I thought we were being shot at at the time because the velocity of the metal it hit so hard that for a second I thought it was a bullet,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/exclusive-debris-subway-tracks-shattered-mans-windshield-dented-car-queens/16217411/>said Rahimi</a>. The city promises inspections. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every death is a choice made by leaders who wait, by police who look away, by laws left unenforced. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement. Demand action.</p><p>Do not wait for another body in the road.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
