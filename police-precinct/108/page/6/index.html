Harden right turns for box trucks on Greenpoint Avenue. Daylight the mouths along Queens Boulevard. Put leading walk signals at 46th Street and 47th Avenue. Treat the BQE frontage like the danger it is: slow entries, better channelization, and barriers that keep speeds down. Focus night enforcement where the deaths cluster.</p><p>Then go bigger. The city has the tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can set slower limits. A 20 mph default on local streets would cut the force that breaks bodies. And the state has a bill to stop the worst repeat offenders. Drivers with long records of tickets kill more often. Speed limiters would cap the harm.</p><p>These are not theories.

The bike burst into flames. The rider died at the scene. Helmet cam footage captured the deadly chase. The driver faces murder charges. Streets became a killing ground.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on April 25, 2025, that Jorden Rosen, 42, was charged with murder after striking and killing William McField, 55, in Queens. The incident began with a minor collision and escalated as both vehicles ran a red light. Helmet cam footage showed Rosen rear-ending the motorcycle, causing it to catch fire and kill McField instantly. Queens DA Melinda Katz stated, "As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision." The BMW also struck another car before stopping. Rosen had prior traffic summonses for speeding and driving the wrong way. The case highlights the lethal risk of aggressive driving and the deadly power imbalance between cars and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
