A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking for him. It was the second hit-and-run in the city in 24 hours. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> in crashes in Precinct 73. <strong>Over 550 have been injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never recover.

They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people keep getting hit. They can do more. They must do more.</p><p>The city has started to lower speed limits in some places. But in Brownsville and Ocean Hill, the blood on the street says it is not enough. The police in Precinct 73 can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and drivers who run. They can make it clear: these are not accidents. They are choices. They are crimes.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong></p><p>Call your council member.
