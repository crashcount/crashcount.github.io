Twenty-five more have suffered serious injuries</strong> since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>). The names fade, but the pain lingers. A 26-year-old woman, dead in the front seat of a sedan on Blake Avenue. A 72-year-old man, killed crossing Sutter Avenue with the light. A 39-year-old driver, gone on Powell Street. Each one a life cut short, a family left with silence.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars, trucks, and buses do the damage. The numbers are steady, the blood is real. In the last year alone, four more deaths, ten more left with life-altering wounds (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>). The disaster moves slow, but it never stops.</p><h3 id=reckless-driving-broken-lives>Reckless Driving, Broken Lives</h3><p>The violence is not hidden. It happens in daylight, in the open. On June 18, a cyclist was crushed on Newport Street. On May 10, a man was killed in the crosswalk at Osborn and Sutter. The stories repeat. The faces change. The outcome does not.</p><p><strong>Reckless driving is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. It is a system that lets drivers speed, run lights, and walk away. The police know the hotspots. They know the patterns. They have the tools to act. They just need to use them.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. But talk does not stop cars. The city has new powers—<strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York set its own speed limits. The law is there. The will is not. The city can lower the limit to 20 mph. It has not. The police can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. They can target the streets where people keep dying. They can stop the next crash before it happens.</p><p>The families wait. The numbers climb. <strong>“It was just a freak accident. Nothing intentional. I know that he loved her. He loved her dearly,”</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said a relative after a woman was killed by her boyfriend doing donuts in a parking lot</a>. The words do not bring her back. The tire marks are still there, days later.</p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand that Precinct 73 uses every tool to protect the people who walk and bike these streets.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The disaster is slow, but it is not unstoppable.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
