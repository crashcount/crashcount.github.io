The bicyclist suffered facial contusions and bruises but was conscious and not ejected. The sedan sustained front-end damage.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 28-year-old male bicyclist traveling southbound on Rockaway Ave was struck on his left side doors by a northbound sedan making a left turn. The sedan's center front end was the point of impact, causing damage to the vehicle's front. The bicyclist sustained facial contusions and bruises and was conscious after the crash. The report lists the bicyclist's contributing factors as unspecified but does not attribute any specific fault or error to him. The sedan driver was licensed and operating the vehicle during the left turn maneuver. The collision highlights the dangers posed by turning vehicles to bicyclists traveling straight through intersections. No helmet or other safety equipment was reported for the bicyclist, but no contributing factor was assigned to that. The report does not specify driver errors such as failure to yield, but the left turn by the sedan into the bicyclist's path was the critical event.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The vehicle's pre-crash action is listed as 'Backing,' and the point of impact was the 'Center Back End.' No contributing factors are cited for the pedestrian; the driver’s maneuver—reversing a large truck into a crosswalk—created the danger.
