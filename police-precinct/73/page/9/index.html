A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking for him. It was the second hit-and-run in the city in 24 hours. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> in crashes in Precinct 73. <strong>Over 550 have been injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never recover. The numbers do not stop. They do not slow down.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p>The dead are not alone. In the past year, 57 children were hurt.

The danger stays the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people keep getting hit. They can do more. They must do more.</p><p>The city has started to lower speed limits in some places. But in Brownsville and Ocean Hill, the blood on the street says it is not enough. The police in Precinct 73 can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and drivers who run. They can make it clear: these are not accidents. They are choices. They are crimes.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where a man can cross at night and make it home.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The point of impact was the SUV's left side doors and the sedan's left front bumper, causing damage to both vehicles. The SUV carried two occupants: a 74-year-old male driver and a 40-year-old female passenger. Both were conscious but sustained neck injuries and complaints of whiplash. Both occupants were restrained with lap belts and harnesses. The sedan driver was licensed in New York and was executing a left turn at the time of collision. The police report lists the contributing factors as unspecified, but the collision dynamics indicate a failure related to the left-turning maneuver impacting the SUV's side.
