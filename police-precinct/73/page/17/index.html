Seven seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year, the streets of Precinct 73 have not been quiet. The numbers are blunt: 922 crashes, 570 injuries, 7 left with wounds that will not heal. Three people did not come home. These are not numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors.</p><p>Larry Maxwell, 72, was crossing Sutter Avenue to join his family for a cookout. A driver, fleeing another crash, struck him and kept going. His son, Larnce Vargas, stood on the sidewalk and watched the police and EMS surround his father. “I was just on the phone with him. We just finished watching the Knicks game, actually. Right after the game we were supposed to meet up at the park across the street for a cookout—right across the street from the building he was coming out of. He got struck right in front of the building.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>Imani Vance, 26, died in the front seat of a Mercedes. The driver, unlicensed, ran a stop sign and slammed into a school bus. He left her behind and ran. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/driver-charged-east-new-york-hit-and-run/>called it out</a>: “The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant&rsquo;s reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds.”</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h2><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Laws to hold reckless drivers accountable. But the tools are only as strong as the will to use them. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Speed cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits, but the streets here still wait for action.</p><p>The police in Precinct 73 can do more. They can target speeding. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at the corners where blood stains the curb. They can make it clear: these deaths are not fate.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not a storm. It is a slow bleed.</strong> Every day without action is another day a family waits for a knock on the door. The numbers will not change themselves.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand that the police in Precinct 73 use every tool they have.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
