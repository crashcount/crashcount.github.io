The outcome does not.</p><p><strong>Reckless driving is not an accident.</strong> It is a choice. It is a system that lets drivers speed, run lights, and walk away. The police know the hotspots. They know the patterns. They have the tools to act. They just need to use them.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders talk about safety. But talk does not stop cars. The city has new powers—<strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York set its own speed limits. The law is there. The will is not. The city can lower the limit to 20 mph. It has not. The police can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and reckless driving. They can target the streets where people keep dying. They can stop the next crash before it happens.</p><p>The families wait. The numbers climb. <strong>“It was just a freak accident. Nothing intentional. I know that he loved her. He loved her dearly,”</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said a relative after a woman was killed by her boyfriend doing donuts in a parking lot</a>. The words do not bring her back. The tire marks are still there, days later.</p><h3 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand that Precinct 73 uses every tool to protect the people who walk and bike these streets.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The disaster is slow, but it is not unstoppable.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city will close the cut-through, ban parking at corners, and add pedestrian space. Confusion and blocked sight lines fueled crashes. Change comes after loss and pressure.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on April 28, 2025, that the city will close a dangerous Bushwick intersection after a fatal crash killed motorcyclist Philippe Haussmann. The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
