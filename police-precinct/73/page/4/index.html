In the last twelve months, two people died and 571 were injured in crashes. Six suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch: 433 crashes so far this year, already more than last year. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><p><strong>The dead are not nameless.</strong> Larry Maxwell, 72, was crossing Sutter Avenue to meet his family for a cookout. A driver, fleeing another crash, struck him and kept going. Maxwell’s son, Larnce Vargas, stood on the sidewalk and watched police surround his father. “There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large, if there&rsquo;s so many cameras? Y&rsquo;all can find any and everybody else, but y&rsquo;all can&rsquo;t find him. That don&rsquo;t make sense.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>Vargas said</a>.</p><p>Imani Vance, 26, died in the front seat of a Mercedes. The driver, unlicensed, blew a stop sign and slammed into a school bus. He left her there and ran. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez said, “The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant&rsquo;s reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds.” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/driver-charged-east-new-york-hit-and-run/>Gonzalez said</a>.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-the-police>The Role of the Police</h2><p><strong>Precinct 73 has the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They can act, or they can wait for the next call. The law is not a shield for the reckless. It is a hammer, if they choose to use it.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay</h2><p><strong>The city has new power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands. The cameras are up, but the law that keeps them running is at risk. Each day of delay is another day for the next crash.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices—by drivers, by leaders, by those who look away. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand action. <strong>Lower the speed. Enforce the law. Protect the living.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A 39-year-old male driver, licensed in New York, was operating a 2019 Nissan sedan traveling westbound when he experienced an illness.

The point of impact was the center front end of the Nissan and the center back ends of the parked vehicles. The driver was injured, sustaining chest trauma and internal complaints, but was not ejected and was conscious at the scene. The police report cites 'Illness' and 'Pavement Slippery' as contributing factors, highlighting the driver’s medical emergency and road conditions as primary causes.
