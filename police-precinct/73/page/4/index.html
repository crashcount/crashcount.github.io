Seven seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year, the streets of Precinct 73 have not been quiet. The numbers are blunt: 922 crashes, 570 injuries, 7 left with wounds that will not heal. Three people did not come home. These are not numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors.</p><p>Larry Maxwell, 72, was crossing Sutter Avenue to join his family for a cookout. A driver, fleeing another crash, struck him and kept going. His son, Larnce Vargas, stood on the sidewalk and watched the police and EMS surround his father. “I was just on the phone with him. We just finished watching the Knicks game, actually. Right after the game we were supposed to meet up at the park across the street for a cookout—right across the street from the building he was coming out of. He got struck right in front of the building.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>Imani Vance, 26, died in the front seat of a Mercedes. The driver, unlicensed, ran a stop sign and slammed into a school bus. He left her behind and ran. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/driver-charged-east-new-york-hit-and-run/>called it out</a>: “The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant&rsquo;s reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds.”</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h2><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Laws to hold reckless drivers accountable. But the tools are only as strong as the will to use them. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Speed cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits, but the streets here still wait for action.</p><p>The police in Precinct 73 can do more. They can target speeding. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can stand at the corners where blood stains the curb.

The point of impact was the sedan’s right front bumper, which sustained damage. The bicyclist, who was not wearing safety equipment, was injured with knee, lower leg, and foot trauma and was reported to be in shock with complaints of pain or nausea. The report lists unspecified contributing factors but highlights the sedan’s left turn maneuver as the critical action preceding the collision. No driver errors such as failure to yield are explicitly cited, but the turning vehicle’s movement directly caused the crash. The bicyclist was not ejected and sustained moderate injuries.
