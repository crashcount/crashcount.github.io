A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking for him. It was the second hit-and-run in the city in 24 hours. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> in crashes in Precinct 73. <strong>Over 550 have been injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never recover.

They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people keep getting hit. They can do more. They must do more.</p><p>The city has started to lower speed limits in some places. But in Brownsville and Ocean Hill, the blood on the street says it is not enough. The police in Precinct 73 can crack down on speeding, failure to yield, and drivers who run. They can make it clear: these are not accidents. They are choices. They are crimes.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong></p><p>Call your council member.

An e-bike delivery worker sped through a stop sign. The crash was sudden. Cruz died on the street. The rider stayed. The intersection has seen this before. The system pushes speed. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on March 23, 2025, that Luis Cruz, 49, died after an e-bike delivery worker "sped through a stop sign" and struck him as he exited his double-parked car in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
