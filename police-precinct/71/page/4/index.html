Add leading pedestrian intervals at Montgomery/Brooklyn and Eastern/Albany. Slow the left turns that erase people in the crosswalk.</p><p>Target evening hours.

She struck a for-hire car, then hit Natasha Saada and her three children, killing the mother and two daughters. The surviving son remains in a coma.

Police say Yarimi was "probably doing close to twice the speed limit" and "ran a red light" before hitting an Uber and then a family crossing the street. Three pedestrians—Natasha Saada, 34, and her daughters, ages 8 and 5—were killed. A 4-year-old remains hospitalized. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called the driving "almost being wanton." Yarimi’s car had multiple prior tickets from red light and speed cameras. The crash highlights ongoing policy concerns about repeat traffic offenders and street safety. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the city "is still working to make streets safer, emphasizing the need to protect vulnerable New Yorkers."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On March 30, Miriam Yarimi, driving with a suspended license and 93 prior traffic violations, crashed into an Uber and then into a family, killing Natasha Saada and two of her children. A third child remains in critical condition. The article quotes Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives: Ocean Parkway is 'one of Brooklyn's most dangerous roads.' Residents and advocates demand stronger safety measures, including speed-limiting technology for repeat offenders. Mayor Eric Adams is open to lowering the speed limit, but state approval is needed. Despite Vision Zero, Ocean Parkway remains hazardous for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes said the driver 'clearly would've met the threshold.' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crash 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.'
