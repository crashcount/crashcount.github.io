Six people killed. Thirty-one left with serious injuries. More than 1,800 hurt since 2022. The dead include a child, a centenarian, and a man struck down crossing Eastern Parkway. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken families, empty chairs, and shoes left behind in the street.</p><p>Just last month, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV at Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. In April, a 101-year-old woman was struck and killed crossing with the signal at Montgomery Street and Brooklyn Avenue. The driver was unlicensed. The car was an SUV. The story is always the same: speed, distraction, failure to yield. The cost is always paid by the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting-game>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting Game</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target the corners where people keep dying. But enforcement alone is not enough. Local leaders have the power to demand safer streets, lower speed limits, and redesign deadly crossings.</p><p>But the clock keeps ticking. The bodies keep coming. &ldquo;We wait until someone dies.

The police can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Leaders can push for real street redesigns, not just paint.
