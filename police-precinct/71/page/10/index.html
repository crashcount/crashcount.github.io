Killed Crossing Legally. Who Will Stop the Next One?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 6, 2025 <em>(Revised July 3, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Precinct 71: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 6, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-toll-on-our-streets>The Toll on Our Streets</h3><p>A woman, 101 years old, stepped into the crosswalk at Brooklyn Avenue and Montgomery Street. She had the walk signal. A GMC Yukon turned left. The driver had no license. She died twelve days later. Her name was Taibel Brod. Her son called it a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>&ldquo;tragedy&rdquo;</a>. Her grandson said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/us-news/hasidic-family-matriarch-who-fled-russia-after-world-war-ii-fatally-struck-by-unlicensed-driver-in-nyc-independent-till-her-last-day/>&ldquo;She was extremely independent till her last day.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>Precinct 71 saw 1 death, 6 serious injuries, and 391 people hurt</strong> in crashes. The dead are mostly the old, the young, the ones on foot. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main weapons.</strong> In the past three years, SUVs and sedans caused the most pain: 2 deaths, 10 serious injuries, 69 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are small. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but the law often does. The man who killed Taibel Brod was charged and released with a desk ticket. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Precinct 71, the pace is slow. No new street redesigns at the site of the latest death. No public statements from local leaders. The police have the tools: they can ticket speeders, crack down on failure to yield, target crash hotspots. They just need to use them. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by a driver, a city, a system. The police in Precinct 71 can act. The council members can demand change. The mayor can lower the speed limit. You can call them. You can demand action. You can refuse to let another family grieve alone.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next obituary.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
