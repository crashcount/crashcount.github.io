Six people killed. Thirty-one left with serious injuries. More than 1,800 hurt since 2022. The dead include a child, a centenarian, and a man struck down crossing Eastern Parkway. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken families, empty chairs, and shoes left behind in the street.</p><p>Just last month, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV at Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. In April, a 101-year-old woman was struck and killed crossing with the signal at Montgomery Street and Brooklyn Avenue. The driver was unlicensed. The car was an SUV. The story is always the same: speed, distraction, failure to yield. The cost is always paid by the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting-game>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting Game</h3><p>The police have the tools.

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He crashed into a Volvo at Avenue U, triggering a chain-reaction that sent the Volvo into a marked NYPD car. The article states, "One police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip." A passenger in the Suburban was ejected and critically injured. The driver, Diyorjon Sobirjonov, was charged with DWI, reckless endangerment, and related offenses after refusing a blood-alcohol test.

The lane calmed a deadly stretch. Drivers still parked illegally. Children darted into traffic. Now, cyclists and pedestrians face more danger. Policy shifts, safety slips. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
