Six people killed. Thirty-one left with serious injuries. More than 1,800 hurt since 2022. The dead include a child, a centenarian, and a man struck down crossing Eastern Parkway. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken families, empty chairs, and shoes left behind in the street.</p><p>Just last month, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV at Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. In April, a 101-year-old woman was struck and killed crossing with the signal at Montgomery Street and Brooklyn Avenue. The driver was unlicensed. The car was an SUV. The story is always the same: speed, distraction, failure to yield. The cost is always paid by the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting-game>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting Game</h3><p>The police have the tools.

The motorcycle rider, a 35-year-old male, was struck on the center front end and thrown face-first, sustaining severe facial lacerations and bleeding. The report states, 'An SUV turned left. A motorcycle came straight. No helmet. The rider flew, face-first. Flesh tore. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He stayed awake. Eyes open.' The SUV sustained damage to its right front quarter panel. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence clearly shows the SUV turning left into the motorcycle's path. The rider was not wearing a helmet, noted after the driver actions. The driver of the SUV was a 32-year-old male, wearing a lap belt and harness, and suffered minor abrasions.
