Six people killed. Thirty-one left with serious injuries. More than 1,800 hurt since 2022. The dead include a child, a centenarian, and a man struck down crossing Eastern Parkway. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken families, empty chairs, and shoes left behind in the street.</p><p>Just last month, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV at Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. In April, a 101-year-old woman was struck and killed crossing with the signal at Montgomery Street and Brooklyn Avenue. The driver was unlicensed. The car was an SUV. The story is always the same: speed, distraction, failure to yield. The cost is always paid by the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting-game>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting Game</h3><p>The police have the tools.

The report states the man was crossing without a signal when the vehicle’s right front quarter panel struck his head, causing crush injuries and leaving him semiconscious and bleeding on the pavement. The police narrative describes the scene: 'The truck’s right front crushed his head. He lay semiconscious on the pavement, bleeding into the dusk.' The driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no further details on driver behavior. The only mention of the pedestrian’s actions is that he was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' which is included after the account of the vehicle’s impact. The focus remains on the devastating outcome of the collision and the lethal force of the truck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
