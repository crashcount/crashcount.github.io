Fifteen left with injuries so grave they are called serious.</strong> Since 2022, more than 1,800 people have been hurt in crashes here. The disaster does not come all at once. It comes in pieces—a body struck, a family changed, a street stained.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole.

No arrests. No answers. The street remains.</p><p>On July 3rd, a driver in a Ford Mustang missed a left turn and plowed onto the sidewalk. <strong>Six people were struck.</strong> The driver ran. The sidewalk was left for the medics and the police. &ldquo;Cops are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>reported the Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed two, seriously hurt two, and left over 290 others with lesser injuries.

The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>209 people under 18 have been hurt here since 2022.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>After years of waiting, the city finally funded a $45 million fix for the deadly intersection at East 177th, Devoe, and East Tremont. <strong>Two deaths and 358 injuries since 2011.</strong> The plan will shorten crossings, add sidewalks, and upgrade signals. &ldquo;We are excited to make progress on this key corridor, which will make incredible pedestrian and vehicular safety improvements,&rdquo; (<a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/city-commits-45-million-redo-dangerous-three-way-intersection-bronx>said DDC’s Ian Michaels</a>).

The shooter, Joseph Meeks, 76, tried four credit cards before the argument escalated. ABC7 reports, "Mr. Barrie asked him to get out of the car and pay him, instead of paying him he shot him in the stomach." Meeks, with about 60 prior arrests, was charged with attempted murder. The United Federation of Taxi Drivers urged the district attorney to deny bail.

Jonathan Rivera, who fatally shot Allan Feliz, unarmed, during a 2019 Bronx traffic stop. Judge Maldonado found Rivera's use of deadly force unjustified, writing it 'requires more than the mere possibility of danger.' Tisch disagreed, citing a 'split-second decision' and risk to another officer. The stop began over a seatbelt. Feliz tried to flee; Rivera fired once, killing him. Tisch's decision echoes the state attorney general, who declined charges.
