He crashes his car into a stop sign near the Bronx Zoo. He calls a cab to the hospital. He dies. The street is left with bullet holes and broken glass. A deli worker stands outside, shaken. &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>he says</a>. The other driver flees. No arrests. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, Precinct 48 saw 1 death, 5 serious injuries, and 473 people hurt in 761 crashes.</strong> Children were not spared—47 injured, none killed, but luck is not a strategy. The old and the young, the cyclist and the pedestrian, all share the same risk. Cars and SUVs did the most damage, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left their mark. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in the street, families waiting for news, shoes left behind on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law. The speed limit can drop to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders. But action is slow. The police have the tools—tickets, enforcement, patrols. They know the hotspots. They know the names. They just need to act. &ldquo;It was like a movie,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>the deli worker said</a>. But this is not a movie. It is the Bronx. It is real.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 48 can do more.</strong> Enforce the speed limit. Crack down on reckless driving. Target the corners where people die. Residents—call your precinct. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Demand it now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
