Fifteen left with injuries so grave they are called serious.</strong> Since 2022, more than 1,800 people have been hurt in crashes here. The disaster does not come all at once. It comes in pieces—a body struck, a family changed, a street stained.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole.

No arrests. No answers. The street remains.</p><p>On July 3rd, a driver in a Ford Mustang missed a left turn and plowed onto the sidewalk. <strong>Six people were struck.</strong> The driver ran. The sidewalk was left for the medics and the police. &ldquo;Cops are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>reported the Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed two, seriously hurt two, and left over 290 others with lesser injuries.

The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><p>Children are not spared. <strong>209 people under 18 have been hurt here since 2022.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>After years of waiting, the city finally funded a $45 million fix for the deadly intersection at East 177th, Devoe, and East Tremont. <strong>Two deaths and 358 injuries since 2011.</strong> The plan will shorten crossings, add sidewalks, and upgrade signals. &ldquo;We are excited to make progress on this key corridor, which will make incredible pedestrian and vehicular safety improvements,&rdquo; (<a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/city-commits-45-million-redo-dangerous-three-way-intersection-bronx>said DDC’s Ian Michaels</a>).
