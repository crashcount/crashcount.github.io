Thirteen of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a heartbeat. The dead include pedestrians, cyclists, passengers, and riders. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just days ago, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole. His 71-year-old passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, never made it home. Seven others were hurt. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>said, &ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No answers. Only loss.</p><p>On July 3rd, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the sidewalk and struck six people. He ran. The victims went to the hospital. Police are still <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>looking for him. &ldquo;Cops are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx, authorities said.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Most of the harm comes from cars and SUVs.</strong> Sedans and SUVs alone account for over 280 pedestrian injuries and 2 deaths. Trucks and buses add more. Motorcycles and mopeds leave bodies broken. Bikes cause a handful of injuries, but the carnage comes on four wheels.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, 54 people under 18 were hurt in crashes here. The old are not safe either. Nine people over 75 were injured. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can make a difference. But the numbers show the work is not done. Local leaders have the power to demand more enforcement, safer street design, and lower speed limits. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Demand action. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them to enforce the law, slow the cars, and protect the people who walk these streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
