The e-scooter driver, a 31-year-old woman, sustained contusions and injuries to her elbow, lower arm, and hand but was conscious and not ejected. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors for the sedan driver. The sedan's point of impact was the left front bumper, while the e-scooter was struck at its center front end. The e-scooter driver was licensed but no victim behaviors were cited as contributing factors.
