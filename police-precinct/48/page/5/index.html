The report states the SUV was making a left turn when the moped, traveling straight, collided with the SUV's right front bumper. The moped rider, a 30-year-old man, suffered crush injuries to his head. The police report attributes the collision to 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' The moped rider's helmet cracked under the impact, but he remained conscious at the scene. The SUV sustained no damage, while the moped absorbed the force. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the danger faced by vulnerable road users when drivers fail to yield.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
