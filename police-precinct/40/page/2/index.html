Fifty-four left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> Since 2022, more than 2,350 people have been hurt in crashes here. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Just last month, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the curb and struck six people. The driver ran. The sidewalk did not forgive. All six went to Lincoln Hospital. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>Police are still looking for him.</a></p><p>A week before, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died. Seven others were hurt. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>&ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known,&rdquo; police said.</a> No one was arrested. The street was quiet again.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> They have taken four lives and left more than 300 injured. Trucks and buses have killed one, hurt dozens. Motorcycles and mopeds, one dead, twenty-two hurt. Bikes, eleven injured. The numbers are not abstract. They are bodies in the road.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. No one is spared. In the last year, deaths doubled. Injuries rose by more than a quarter. Serious injuries up nearly forty percent. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p><strong>The city finally funded a $45 million fix for the deadly intersection at East 177th, Devoe, and Tremont.</strong> It took seventeen years. In that time, two died and 358 were hurt. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/city-commits-45-million-redo-dangerous-three-way-intersection-bronx>&ldquo;We are excited to make progress on this key corridor,&rdquo; said DDC’s Ian Michaels.</a> Progress is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><p>The police in Precinct 40 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, crack down on failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood pools. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. The next body in the road could be someone you love.
