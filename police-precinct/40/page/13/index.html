Forty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,100 hurt since 2022. The dead are not just numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. A cyclist crushed by a turning MTA bus on East 149th (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mta-bus-driver-fatally-strikes-57-year-old-cyclist-in-the-bronx-officials-say>Gothamist</a>).

A pedestrian killed by a taxi on East 149th. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars led the body count</strong>—four killed, thirteen seriously injured, eighty-seven with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses took more: one dead, five with life-altering injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, one dead. Bikes, three moderate injuries. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>City Hall talks of Vision Zero. The police promise action. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/rfk-bridge-pedestrian-struck-person-killed-apparent-hit-run-driver-nyc/16636349/>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>. But the dead keep coming. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. The city has the power to lower speed limits, but waits. Each delay is a risk. Each silence is a sentence.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-40>The Role of Precinct 40</h3><p>Precinct 40 holds the line. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But only if they act. Only if the public demands it. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/rfk-bridge-pedestrian-struck-person-killed-apparent-hit-run-driver-nyc/16636349/>said the mayor</a>. The time for words is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Every day without change is another day closer to the next siren, the next family torn apart.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
