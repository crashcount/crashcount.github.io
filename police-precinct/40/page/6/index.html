Trucks and buses took more: one dead, five with life-altering injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, one dead. Bikes, three moderate injuries. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>City Hall talks of Vision Zero.

But the dead keep coming. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. The city has the power to lower speed limits, but waits. Each delay is a risk. Each silence is a sentence.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-40>The Role of Precinct 40</h3><p>Precinct 40 holds the line. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But only if they act. Only if the public demands it. &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/rfk-bridge-pedestrian-struck-person-killed-apparent-hit-run-driver-nyc/16636349/>said the mayor</a>.
