The car struck one person in the crosswalk, then five more, before smashing into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The street was left with screams and blood. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>. Six people went to the hospital. The Mustang had no plates. The city had no answers.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, five people died and 604 were injured on the streets of Precinct 40. Fourteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk right again. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract.</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-delay>The Toll of Delay</h3><p>The police know these corners. They know the hotspots. They have the power to enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and clear sightlines. But the carnage continues. “Once I heard the noise I turned around and it was already on the curb. It immediately backed up and fled,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-sidewalk-shed-crash-melrose/>said Melvin Pemberton</a>. The ambulance came fast. The system did not.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. In three years, they killed four, seriously injured thirteen, and hurt nearly three hundred people on foot. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The city’s response is a whisper.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. They can demand more speed enforcement, daylight corners, and redesign deadly crossings. They can push for a citywide 20 mph limit. They can hold the precinct to account for every unheeded hotspot. But action is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor.
