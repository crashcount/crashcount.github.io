The car struck one person in the crosswalk, then five more, before smashing into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The street was left with screams and blood. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>. Six people went to the hospital. The Mustang had no plates. The city had no answers.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, five people died and 604 were injured on the streets of Precinct 40. Fourteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk right again. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract.</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-delay>The Toll of Delay</h3><p>The police know these corners. They know the hotspots. They have the power to enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and clear sightlines. But the carnage continues. “Once I heard the noise I turned around and it was already on the curb. It immediately backed up and fled,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-sidewalk-shed-crash-melrose/>said Melvin Pemberton</a>. The ambulance came fast. The system did not.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. In three years, they killed four, seriously injured thirteen, and hurt nearly three hundred people on foot. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The city’s response is a whisper.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Talk, Streets Stay Deadly</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. They can demand more speed enforcement, daylight corners, and redesign deadly crossings. They can push for a citywide 20 mph limit. They can hold the precinct to account for every unheeded hotspot. But action is slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell the 40th Precinct captain you want speeders stopped, corners cleared, and every crash hotspot fixed. <strong>Do not wait for another siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pedestrian was crossing against the signal when the vehicle traveling south struck him on the left front quarter panel. Injuries were serious but non-fatal.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 37-year-old male pedestrian was injured at the intersection of Willis Avenue and East 137 Street in the Bronx at 9:54 PM. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal when a 2016 Honda SUV traveling south struck him on the left front quarter panel. The pedestrian sustained contusions and bruises over his entire body and was conscious after the impact. The report lists 'crossing against signal' as a pedestrian action but does not cite any driver contributing factors or errors such as failure to yield or speeding. The SUV was going straight ahead with one licensed male driver. Vehicle damage was limited to the left front quarter panel. The report does not assign blame to the pedestrian but highlights the pedestrian's crossing behavior as a factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
