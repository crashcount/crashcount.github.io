Same ending.</p><p>Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass on the Bronx River Parkway near E. 223rd just after 1 a.m. He hit a Volkswagen. Then he hit two bikes. Both riders were thrown and died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He was identified as Mauricio Neyra Yuyes. The victims were Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist reported the charges and names</a>. AMNY detailed the arrest and charges, and the Highway Collision Investigation Squad’s probe <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>remains open</a>. A Daily News brief echoed the sequence: tried to pass, struck a car, then the motorcycles. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/11/bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>Police said all drivers stayed</a>.</p><p>“Two people were killed. He was drunk,” a victim’s sister said at court, questioning why he was free without bail. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>The Daily News quoted the family’s rage</a>.</p><p>Relentless doesn’t take a night off.</p><p>—</p><p>Night after night</p><p>Crashes cluster after dark here. From 2022 to now, injuries stack up after 8 p.m., with sharp spikes around 8 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. The 8 p.m. hour alone saw 145 injuries and 11 serious injuries; 10 p.m. had 98 injuries and multiple deaths across the period. Late hours at 1–2 a.m. also cut deep. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data shows the hourly toll</a>.</p><p>Heavy vehicles add weight to the harm. Trucks and buses together account for dozens of pedestrian injuries and multiple deaths in this precinct period. SUVs and sedans hurt the most people. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>The rollup is clear in the dataset</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>Corners that don’t forgive</p><p>Bruckner Blvd. and E. 149th Street keep showing up. One death and 58 injuries on Bruckner Blvd.; one death and 168 injuries on East 149th. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>They are top hotspots</a>. At East 149th and Brook Ave., a bus turning left killed a 57‑year‑old cyclist in February. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash record lists the left turn and the death</a>.</p><p>On East 149th again, a taxi going straight struck a 61‑year‑old man overnight in 2024. He died. The contributing factor was listed as driver inattention. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The record is terse and final</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>What the numbers say</p><p>Since 2022, at least <strong>15 people are dead</strong> here, including pedestrians, cyclists, riders, and vehicle occupants. Pedestrians account for 6 of those deaths; cyclists 3; riders on small motorized vehicles 1; others in cars 5. Injuries exceed 2,400. Serious injuries: 56. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>All from NYC’s crash data</a>.</p><p>Contributing factors stack under “other,” a catch‑all covering most deaths. But driver inattention, disregard for signals, and alcohol appear in the logs. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The precinct breakdown shows it</a>. The worst hours are night. The worst roads are wide and fast.</p><p>—</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><p>• East 149th Street: day‑lighting at corners, hardened left turns, and leading pedestrian intervals could slow turning traffic and protect crossings.</p><p>• Bruckner Blvd. and Bruckner Expressway service roads: tighter lanes and concrete to kill speed; truck‑route management to keep the biggest vehicles off local streets where possible.</p><p>• Third Avenue: high injury counts demand speed control and safe bike space along the corridor.</p><p>Targeted night operations at repeat hotspots would meet the harm where it happens. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The hotspot list and hourly spikes point the way</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany renewed the 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. City leaders call cameras life‑saving. With cameras secured, the next steps are slower streets and stopping the worst repeat offenders. Our own citywide brief lays it out. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action explains the path</a>.</p><p>A small group of drivers do outsize harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in a year are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; 30+ tickets multiplies risk fifty‑fold. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog’s analysis is blunt</a>. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force speed limiters on those repeat violators. <a href=../../take_action/>See the details and call script here</a>.</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to lower limits. A 20 mph default on local streets is ready to go. <a href=../../take_action/>Our action page has the contacts</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>Do one thing now</p><p>Two riders died on the parkway. The list is longer than these names. Ask City Hall and the Council to drop the default speed to 20 mph and rein in repeat speeders. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action today</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
