Eight left with wounds that will never heal.</strong> In the last three years, Precinct 6 has seen 1,180 crashes. Four hundred eighty-two people hurt. The dead do not speak. The living remember.</p><p>A cyclist crushed by a hit-and-run driver at 5th Avenue and West 13th. &ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; said Myung Jin Chung, who woke up in the ambulance, memory gone, bones broken, after a driver blew through a red light and fled the scene. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/52-year-old-cyclist-injured-traumatic-hit-run-west-village-speaks/16395629/>He thought it might be his fault. It wasn&rsquo;t.</a></p><p>A uniformed officer pinned by a spinning Dodge Charger at W. 13th and Seventh. The car hit a street sweeper, spun out, and trapped the officer against his own patrol car. &ldquo;The driver of the Charger appeared to be speeding,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/14/nypd-officer-struck-and-pinned-by-out-of-control-dodge-charger-in-manhattan/>told the press</a>. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/14/nypd-officer-struck-and-pinned-by-out-of-control-dodge-charger-in-manhattan/>The officer tried to run but didn’t have enough time to avoid being struck.</a></p><p>A wrong-way driver fleeing police struck a cyclist on West Third. The cyclist survived. The driver kept going. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/18/bicyclist-struck-by-wrong-way-driver-fleeing-police-in-greenwich-village/>The city keeps counting.</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-not-enough>Leadership: Words, Not Enough</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools. The precinct has the power.</strong> Speed cameras slash speeding by more than half where installed. Enforcement works—when it happens. But the law authorizing speed cameras is again facing expiration. No word from local leaders on why the clock keeps running out.</p><p>The NYPD can crack down on reckless driving, failure to yield, speeding. They can target crash hotspots. They can write tickets. They can save lives. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last year, 175 people were hurt in crashes here. Three were seriously injured. No one died—this year. Last year, one person did. The dead are not statistics. They are neighbors, friends, parents, children.</p><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars, SUVs, and trucks.</strong> But taxis, bikes, and mopeds leave their mark too. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at crash hotspots. Demand that every death is treated like the crime it is. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
