Twenty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 1,800 people hurt since 2022. The violence comes in waves—cars, SUVs, trucks, motorcycles. The streets do not forgive mistakes. The bodies are young and old. Children, elders, workers, neighbors. No one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman died in Co-op City.</strong> A 79-year-old man behind the wheel slammed into two cars, then a pole. Six others were hurt. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. The street was full of sirens and broken glass. The pain lingers.</p><p>Last week, a truck overturned and poured liquid asphalt across a Bronx road. No one died, but the street became a hazard. &ldquo;Liquid asphalt poured onto a road in the Bronx after a truck overturned Wednesday,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/truck-overturns-spills-liquid-asphalt-on-bronx-road/>reported CBS New York</a>. The cleanup took hours. The risk was real.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed two, seriously hurt seven, and left nearly 200 people injured. Trucks and buses have killed one and hurt many more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The victims are not just numbers. They are people who crossed the street, waited for a bus, or rode a bike to work.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-power>Leadership: Promises and Power</h2><p>The city has new tools. Speed limits can drop. Cameras can catch the reckless. But change is slow. The police in Precinct 45 hold the power to enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, crack down on failure to yield, and target the corners where blood has been spilled. They know where the danger lies. They just need to act.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power to act—or not. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
