She is eighteen. She was thrown from the back of a scooter on the Hutchinson River Parkway. The driver left her there. Police say, &ldquo;An 18-year-old was in critical condition after being thrown from a moped in the hit-and-run&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/7-hurt-in-crash-on-hutchinson-river-parkway-near-whitestone-bridge/>CBS New York</a>). Six others went to the hospital. The cars kept moving. The city did not stop.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>533 people have been injured in crashes in Precinct 45</strong>. Six were hurt so badly they may never walk the same. Two are dead. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p>The young are not spared. Thirty-six children were hurt in the last year. The old are not spared. One man, sixty-five, died. The city records the numbers. The numbers keep rising.</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two. Trucks killed one. Mopeds, bikes, buses—they leave bruises, but the big machines break bodies. The police know this. They see the wreckage. They write the reports.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>The mayor says, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/hutchinson-river-parkway-accident-bronx-involving-moped-driver-injures-7/16808062/>ABC7</a>). The police commissioner promises, &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/hutchinson-river-parkway-accident-bronx-involving-moped-driver-injures-7/16808062/>ABC7</a>). But the parkways run fast and the tickets come slow. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. The speed cameras are not everywhere. The silence is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-the-precinct-can-do>What the Precinct Can Do</h3><p><strong>Precinct 45 can act.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where children cross and the old men shuffle. They can make it hurt to drive reckless. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand action at crash hotspots. Demand that the mayor and the NYPD treat every injury as a failure, not a fact of life. The numbers will not stop unless you make them.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
