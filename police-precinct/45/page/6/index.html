Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 1,677 have been hurt on these streets. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. They only grow.</p><p>A man tried to stop a thief from taking his car on Wilkinson Avenue. He was dragged, crushed, and left in the street. His leg was torn away. He may never walk again. &ldquo;This has absolutely happened before,&rdquo; a neighbor told the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/26/bronx-carjacking-victim-leg-amputated-dragged-half-mile/>Daily News</a>. The blood dries, but the story repeats.</p><p>On the expressways and parkways, the pattern holds. Pedestrians and drivers alike are broken by SUVs, trucks, sedans. A 66-year-old man was crushed crossing the Hutchinson River Parkway. A 40-year-old pedestrian was killed by an SUV on Westchester Avenue. The police write the reports. The families bury their dead.</p><h3 id=the-police-tools-in-hand-action-needed>The Police: Tools in Hand, Action Needed</h3><p><strong>The 45th Precinct has the power to act.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners and corridors where the bodies pile up. But the silence is heavy. The numbers say more than the press releases. In the last year alone, crashes rose by a third. Injuries climbed. The dead stayed dead.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They talk of new laws and lower speed limits. But in the Bronx, the crisis is not abstract. It is a man in surgery, a family waiting outside Jacobi Hospital. &ldquo;Detectives believe the suspect intentionally sideswiped a parked car,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-carjacking-victim-violent-car-theft-has-leg-amputated-leaving-work-jfk-airport/16247931/>ABC7 reported</a>. The Bronx saw car thefts rise while the rest of the city saw them fall. The danger is not just numbers. It is flesh and bone.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now: Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The police can enforce the law. The city can lower the speed limit. The council can fund street redesigns. But nothing changes unless you demand it. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them you are tired of blood in the gutter. Tell them to act.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Demand action now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
