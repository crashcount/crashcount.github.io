Twenty-nine left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the roads of Precinct 45 have not been quiet. The numbers do not flinch: 2,923 crashes, 1,792 people hurt, eight never coming home again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, fathers, children. On July 11, a 71-year-old woman was killed in Co-op City. A 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. The impact sent metal into flesh. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. Six others were hurt. No arrests.

The driver kept going straight. The pedestrian did not get up again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Two deaths by SUV, one by truck, two by cars. Trucks and buses crushed 19 people. Motorcycles and mopeds left eight more broken. Bikes injured three. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The parkway is not safe.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has the tools. Albany handed them the power to lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the carnage continues. Local leaders have not made Precinct 45 a model for safety. The silence is loud. No bold new plans. No public reckoning. The police have the power to enforce the law, to crack down on speeding, reckless driving, failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand real protection for people who walk, bike, and take the bus. &ldquo;It was a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Jennifer</a>.

Steel scraped concrete. Debris rained down. No one was hurt. The wall broke. The rules broke first.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on January 17, 2025, that a BxM1 MTA bus nearly plunged from the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass after the driver swerved to avoid an illegally double-parked car. The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was crushed beneath the vehicle and died at the scene. The incident occurred at 23:41. The police report does not cite any pedestrian behaviors as contributing factors. The deadly impact and fatal outcome were directly linked to driver actions and the systemic danger posed by turning vehicles failing to yield to people in the crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
