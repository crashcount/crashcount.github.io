Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, more than 1,600 people have been hurt in 2,788 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper.</p><p>A 27-year-old Navy veteran, Keino Campbell, was shot dead after a minor crash at Givan and Palmer. His mother, Suzette Thomas, said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/u-s-navy-veteran-killed-road-rage-arrest-nyc/>&ldquo;I want people to remember my son as a humble person, one to do the best for the world.&rdquo;</a> His father <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-road-rage-arrest-made-navy-veteran-keino-campbell-shot-killed-dispute/16766460/>pleaded</a>, &ldquo;Stop jumping out of car and shooting people, guys. Use your insurance. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.&rdquo;</p><p>A 32-year-old man lost his leg in a carjacking on Wilkinson Avenue. He tried to stop the thief. The thief sped off, sideswiped a parked car, and left him bleeding in the street. The Bronx saw a rise in car thefts while the rest of the city saw a drop. The violence is not random. It is routine.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and older adults are not spared.</strong> In the last year, a 66-year-old man was crushed crossing the Hutchinson River Parkway. A 68-year-old driver died on Schley Avenue. Children, too, are among the injured—36 in the last twelve months.</p><p>The killers are not ghosts. <strong>SUVs, sedans, and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars killed two, trucks killed one, and motorcycles and bikes killed none. The streets are not safe for anyone on foot or behind the wheel.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They can enforce speed limits, crack down on reckless driving, and target crash hotspots.</strong> The NYPD can issue tickets for speeding and failure to yield. They can show up where the blood pools. But the silence is thick. No recent public statements or bold action from local officials in this precinct. No new bills. No press conferences. The work is left to the families and the dead.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Demand more from your precinct. Demand more from your council member. Call for speed enforcement, safer crossings, and action—not words. <strong>Contact your local leaders and tell them: Enough.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
