Twenty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, nearly 1,800 neighbors have been hurt in crashes. Each number is a body on the asphalt, a family changed forever.</p><p>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman died after a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole in Co-op City. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said a witness</a>. Seven others were injured. There were no arrests. The cause is still under investigation. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>Police said</a> only that all drivers remained at the scene.</p><p><strong>This is not an isolated event.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, three people have died and over 600 have been injured in this precinct. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians, SUVs and sedans are the main weapons. Trucks and buses kill too. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes cause a fraction of the pain, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The streets are not safe for the old or the young. &ldquo;It was a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said another neighbor</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras now run 24/7. The law allows lower speed limits. But in Precinct 45, the blood keeps flowing. Police can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can make a difference. But they must act. Local leaders must demand more. Every delay is another body in the road.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more from your leaders and your precinct.</strong> Call Council Member <a href=/council-district/12/>Kevin C. Riley</a>, Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/82/>Michael Benedetto</a>, and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/34/>Nathalia Fernández</a>. Tell them the deaths must stop. Tell the 45th Precinct to enforce the law, target speeders, and protect the most vulnerable. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
