Police say a 21-year-old in a Mercedes tried to pass, clipped a Volkswagen, and struck two motorbikes. Both riders died. Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test, according to the complaint. “Police have arrested and charged a man… in a multivehicle crash… that killed two people,” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist reported</a>. The victims were identified as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21.</p><p>Family stood in court and spoke plain. “Two people were killed. He was drunk,” a sister said, asking why he walked free after arraignment. “How could they let him go?” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>the Daily News reported</a>.</p><h3 id=parkways-lead-the-body-count>Parkways lead the body count</h3><p>In Precinct 45, the worst toll sits on the highways. Since 2022, the <a href=#>Hutchinson River Parkway</a> leads with two deaths and 210 injuries; the <a href=#>Bruckner Expressway</a> shows one death and 336 injuries. Another death came on <a href=#>Hutchinson River Parkway East</a>. These are not quirks. They are corridors of harm in this command’s map. The city’s crash data marks them as top locations in this period.</p><p>Pedestrians take the blows in the neighborhood streets too: four killed, 244 injured since 2022. SUVs and cars are the main culprits in pedestrian harm, with trucks close behind. In this precinct, heavy vehicles and private autos do most of the damage to people on foot, the open data shows.</p><h3 id=the-clock-tells-on-us>The clock tells on us</h3><p>Night hours cut deep here. Injury peaks hit late night and the small hours. The 4 a.m. hour shows two deaths; 11 p.m. shows two more. At 8 p.m., one death. At 10 and 11 a.m., one each. The line never goes flat. The numbers keep coming in, hour after hour, across years.</p><p>Across contributing factors, most killings land in the city’s “other” bucket, with smaller slices in distraction and failure to yield. Labels blur what happened. The outcome does not: five people dead in this precinct since 2022, with hundreds injured.</p><h3 id=a-highway-crash-is-not-a-one-off>A highway crash is not a one-off</h3><p>Two teenagers in court photos become dots on a chart. The dots pile up. On the Hutch, a 66-year-old man died as a pedestrian in 2024, crushed in a multi-vehicle strike, the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city dataset</a> shows under CrashID <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4752748</a>. On St. Raymond Avenue, a truck turning left killed a woman in the crosswalk in 2024, with failure to yield and distraction listed. On the Bruckner, another motorcyclist died in 2025 after a left-turn hit, also logged in the data.</p><h3 id=what-would-make-this-stop-here>What would make this stop here</h3><ul><li>Daylight every approach to the Hutch, Bruckner, East Tremont, and Co-op City’s arterials. Harden left turns where trucks and SUVs swing across crosswalks. Protect crossings with concrete.</li><li>Target the night hours named above with focused enforcement on speeding, drunk and impaired driving, and failure to yield at known hot spots.</li><li>Reroute and regulate heavy vehicles off pedestrian corridors where possible; slow what remains with raised crossings and narrowed entries.</li></ul><p>Citywide steps exist, ready to use. The Council now has the power to lower residential limits. A <strong>default 20 mph</strong> saves lives. Albany renewed school-zone speed cameras all day and night. One more tool aims at the worst drivers: require speed limiters for repeat offenders. The bill on the table would force drivers with a record of camera tickets or DMV points to cap their speed. Read the plan and push it. These measures are laid out in our <a href=/take_action/>action page</a>, with sources and contacts.</p><h3 id=hold-the-line>Hold the line</h3><p>Names become numbers. Numbers become lists. The lists sit on desks. This does not end without choices from people in office. Use the power we have and pass the tools we need. Lower speeds. Box in the repeat offenders. Concrete at the corners. Do it before the next mother asks, again, why the man who killed her child walked out of court.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
