Fifteen seriously injured.</strong> Over 1,800 injured since 2022. The dead include the old and the young. A 74-year-old man, crushed at an intersection. A 43-year-old cyclist, killed on the Belt Parkway. A 48-year-old woman, thrown from a bike and left unconscious on 68th Street. The list goes on. Each one had a name. Each one had a place to be. Now there is only silence.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most damage.</strong> They killed four people and left nearly 250 injured or worse. Trucks and buses, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—all have drawn blood here. But the biggest killers are still behind the wheel of a car or SUV. The numbers are plain: <strong>SUVs and cars caused four deaths and 244 injuries.</strong></p><h3 id=reckless-driving-empty-promises>Reckless Driving, Empty Promises</h3><p>The carnage is not random. It is not fate. It is speed, distraction, and recklessness. In September, a man was killed crossing Bay Ridge Avenue. The driver was not paying attention. In June, a cyclist died on the Belt Parkway. The cause: a car, going straight, did not stop. In another case, a woman was thrown from a bike and died on 68th Street. The pattern is clear. The pain is real.</p><p>A neighbor, after one crash, said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;She was a nice and kind girl, always smiling.&rdquo;</a> The grief is bottomless.

They can redesign streets. They can enforce the law. But the deaths keep coming. The police can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They can write tickets. They just need to act.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family shattered.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-now>Call to Action: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Call your council member.

Prosecutors say Yarimi, a repeat speed and red-light violator, sped through a red light and struck an Uber before hitting Natasha Saada and her two daughters as they crossed Ocean Parkway. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst' crashes he had seen, stating, 'This defendant's unconscionably dangerous driving wiped out a family.' Yarimi was driving with a suspended license. Authorities noted that drivers with multiple camera violations can avoid car seizure by paying fines, exposing policy loopholes. The crash left a four-year-old boy hospitalized with severe injuries. Yarimi faces up to 45 years if convicted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street bears the scars.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on March 30, 2025, that Miriam Yarimi, 32, drove with a suspended license and sped through a Midwood crosswalk, fatally striking Natasha Saada and her daughters, ages 8 and 5. Her 4-year-old son remains in critical condition. Police said Yarimi hit another car before mounting the crosswalk. She faces multiple charges, including manslaughter, reckless driving, and unlicensed operation. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called it 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' Assemblyman Michael Novakhov noted Yarimi's 93 violations and $10,000 in unpaid fines. The crash highlights gaps in enforcement and calls for policy changes, such as speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
