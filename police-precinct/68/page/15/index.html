Over 1,700 injured.</strong> No one is spared—children, elders, workers on their way home. In the last year alone, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single serious injury classified as survivable. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Joel Mota, 22, died on a Bay Ridge street. His brother remembered him as &ldquo;a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Francisco Mota</a>. The driver who killed him was drunk and unlicensed. The city let her drive. The city let him die.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths and 243 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses add more. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of harm falls from behind a steering wheel. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; Bills pass in Albany. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. But in Precinct 68, the deaths keep coming. Enforcement is a choice. The police have the tools. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who look away. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
