Over 1,700 injured.</strong> No one is spared—children, elders, workers on their way home. In the last year alone, three more deaths, 616 injuries, and not a single serious injury classified as survivable. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>Joel Mota, 22, died on a Bay Ridge street. His brother remembered him as &ldquo;a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Francisco Mota</a>. The driver who killed him was drunk and unlicensed. The city let her drive. The city let him die.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths and 243 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses add more. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of harm falls from behind a steering wheel. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; Bills pass in Albany. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. But in Precinct 68, the deaths keep coming. Enforcement is a choice. The police have the tools. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who look away. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill.

According to the article, "Police say that officer fired one shot, striking the driver." The driver then crashed into an NYPD vehicle and later died at the hospital. A passenger was taken into custody. The incident drew a large police response, with one witness describing, "30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that's insane." The report highlights high-speed movement, a roadblock, and the use of deadly force.

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue.

Four people, shaken and hurt, clutched their backs and heads as emergency lights flashed in the night. The air hung heavy with shock and pain, the highway silent but for sirens.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a collision involving three SUVs on the Gowanus Expressway eastbound exit 18 in Brooklyn left four occupants injured. All suffered bodily harm, including back and head injuries, and were described as in shock or conscious at the scene. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for the driver, while 'Other Vehicular' factors were cited for passengers. One of the vehicles was driven by an unlicensed driver, and another was involved in a police pursuit. These driver errors—speeding, distraction, and lack of a valid license—are called out in the official record. No mention of helmet or signal violations appears in the data.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
