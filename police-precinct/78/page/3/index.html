A taxi hits her. She dies. Another woman, sixty, is struck at Flatbush and 4th. She is left unconscious, her head crushed. In three and a half years, two people have died and fifteen have been seriously injured on the streets of Precinct 78. The wounded number over a thousand. The dead do not come back. The injured carry it forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Cars, SUVs, and taxis are the main weapons. They killed two, seriously hurt four, and left dozens with broken bodies. Bikes and motorcycles also draw blood, but the carnage comes on four wheels.</p><h3 id=the-system-respondsslowly>The System Responds—Slowly</h3><p>The city promises change. The Department of Transportation says Flatbush Avenue &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>DOT statement</a></p><p>The plan: center-running bus lanes, boarding islands, fewer car lanes. A corridor for people, not just cars. &ldquo;Our proposal would address each of these issues and create a world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone,&rdquo; says DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>Commissioner Rodriguez&rsquo;s proposal</a></p><p>But the work is not done. The city has not shared the block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. The bus lanes may not be protected. The danger remains for those on foot and bike. Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush Avenue alone. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>Flatbush Avenue toll</a></p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-78>The Role of Precinct 78</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target crash hotspots. They can act—if they choose to see the problem.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every day without action is another day of risk. The city must finish the Flatbush redesign, protect bus lanes, and harden crossings. The precinct must crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Local leaders must hear from you.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill. The crash exposes gaps in enforcement and policy, leaving repeat offenders unchecked and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police identified a stolen Porsche, attempted a traffic stop, and set up a roadblock after the car evaded officers. According to the article, "Police say that officer fired one shot, striking the driver." The driver then crashed into an NYPD vehicle and later died at the hospital. A passenger was taken into custody. The incident drew a large police response, with one witness describing, "30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that's insane." The report highlights high-speed movement, a roadblock, and the use of deadly force. No officers were struck, but the event underscores risks in police pursuits and the dangers posed by fleeing vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An e-bike delivery worker sped through a stop sign. The crash was sudden. Cruz died on the street. The rider stayed. The intersection has seen this before. The system pushes speed. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on March 23, 2025, that Luis Cruz, 49, died after an e-bike delivery worker "sped through a stop sign" and struck him as he exited his double-parked car in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
