A taxi hits her. She dies. Another woman, sixty, is struck at Flatbush and 4th. She is left unconscious, her head crushed. In three and a half years, two people have died and fifteen have been seriously injured on the streets of Precinct 78. The wounded number over a thousand. The dead do not come back. The injured carry it forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Cars, SUVs, and taxis are the main weapons. They killed two, seriously hurt four, and left dozens with broken bodies. Bikes and motorcycles also draw blood, but the carnage comes on four wheels.</p><h3 id=the-system-respondsslowly>The System Responds—Slowly</h3><p>The city promises change. The Department of Transportation says Flatbush Avenue &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>DOT statement</a></p><p>The plan: center-running bus lanes, boarding islands, fewer car lanes. A corridor for people, not just cars. &ldquo;Our proposal would address each of these issues and create a world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone,&rdquo; says DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>Commissioner Rodriguez&rsquo;s proposal</a></p><p>But the work is not done. The city has not shared the block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. The bus lanes may not be protected. The danger remains for those on foot and bike. Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush Avenue alone. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>Flatbush Avenue toll</a></p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-78>The Role of Precinct 78</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target crash hotspots. They can act—if they choose to see the problem.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every day without action is another day of risk. The city must finish the Flatbush redesign, protect bus lanes, and harden crossings. The precinct must crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Local leaders must hear from you.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The move follows complaints from local residents, especially after a viral video showed a child running into the lane from a double-parked car and colliding with an e-bike. Adams stated, 'we listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback.' The Department of Transportation will revert the protected lane to its previous unprotected state between Willoughby and Flushing avenues. The article highlights ongoing political battles over street design and notes that double-parking and chaotic traffic remain unaddressed.

The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states. DOT opposes removing parking without barriers, citing risks of faster, more dangerous turns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue.
