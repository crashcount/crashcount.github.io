A taxi hits her. She dies. Another woman, sixty, is struck at Flatbush and 4th. She is left unconscious, her head crushed. In three and a half years, two people have died and fifteen have been seriously injured on the streets of Precinct 78. The wounded number over a thousand. The dead do not come back. The injured carry it forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Cars, SUVs, and taxis are the main weapons. They killed two, seriously hurt four, and left dozens with broken bodies. Bikes and motorcycles also draw blood, but the carnage comes on four wheels.</p><h3 id=the-system-respondsslowly>The System Responds—Slowly</h3><p>The city promises change. The Department of Transportation says Flatbush Avenue &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone. Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>DOT statement</a></p><p>The plan: center-running bus lanes, boarding islands, fewer car lanes. A corridor for people, not just cars. &ldquo;Our proposal would address each of these issues and create a world-class, welcoming corridor for everyone,&rdquo; says DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>Commissioner Rodriguez&rsquo;s proposal</a></p><p>But the work is not done. The city has not shared the block-by-block plan. Parking may stay. The bus lanes may not be protected. The danger remains for those on foot and bike. Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured on Flatbush Avenue alone. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-flatbush-avenue-gets-bus-lanes-pedestrian-islands-under-dot-plan>Flatbush Avenue toll</a></p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-78>The Role of Precinct 78</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target crash hotspots. They can act—if they choose to see the problem.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every day without action is another day of risk. The city must finish the Flatbush redesign, protect bus lanes, and harden crossings. The precinct must crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Local leaders must hear from you.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor.
