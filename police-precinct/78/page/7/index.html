Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the streets of Precinct 78—Park Slope, Prospect Park, and beyond—have not been gentle. These are not just numbers. They are bodies broken on the pavement, families waiting in hospital halls. In the last twelve months alone, 356 people were hurt in 633 crashes. Three of those injuries were life-altering. No one walked away from those days the same. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Taxis, sedans, SUVs, and trucks all play their part. A 72-year-old woman was killed by a taxi at Flatbush and 5th. Another pedestrian, age 60, was crushed at Flatbush and 4th. Cyclists have been thrown, struck, and left bleeding on Union and Atlantic. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools.</strong> Speed cameras slash speeding. Lower speed limits save lives. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to set safer speeds. But the city drags its feet. The law sits unused. The cameras face expiration unless Albany acts again. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Precinct 78 can do more.</strong> Police can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood has already been spilled. But enforcement is only as strong as the will behind it. The silence of leaders is a choice. So is action.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Crashes are not weather. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by city hall, by the police, by all of us. The tools exist. The data is clear. The bodies are real.</p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them you want lower speed limits, more enforcement, and streets that put people before cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
