Fifteen more have suffered serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been <strong>2,479 crashes</strong>. The wounded are not just numbers—they are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, <strong>one person was killed and 384 injured</strong>. The blood dries, but the pain lingers.</p><p>A 71-year-old cyclist lost his life on West Drive. A 72-year-old woman was struck and killed by a taxi at Flatbush and 5th. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes without warning.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-bikes-and-blood>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, Bikes, and Blood</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs have done the most harm</strong>—one death, 124 minor injuries, 44 moderate, three serious. <strong>Trucks and buses</strong> left 13 injured. <strong>Bikes</strong> caused 22 injuries, including one serious. The numbers are cold, but the stories are not. A cyclist ejected after a crash. A pedestrian never making it across the street.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city has tools. Speed limits can be enforced. Tickets can be written. Hotspots can be watched. But action is not automatic. It takes pressure. It takes voices raised. It takes the will to see the dead and say, enough.</p><p>The police can do more. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target the corners where people keep getting hurt. They can make it clear that the law is not just words on paper.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>A relative, after a recent crash, said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said her daughter</a>. The pain does not fade. Another voice, after a double fatality, said, <strong>&ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said police</a>.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. These are not accidents.</strong> Demand action. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them to enforce the law, to slow the cars, to protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
