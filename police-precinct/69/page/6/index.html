The pedestrian sustained a concussion and upper leg injuries, remaining conscious after the impact. The report does not list any contributing factors from the pedestrian's behavior, placing focus on the vehicle driver's failure to prevent the collision. The absence of driver contributing factors in the data suggests systemic danger at this intersection, where marked crosswalks without signals expose pedestrians to harm from vehicles.
