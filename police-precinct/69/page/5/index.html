A 68-year-old man. A woman in her sixties. In Precinct 69, the dead do not get second chances. In the past twelve months, <strong>2 people were killed and 615 were injured</strong> in crashes here. Six suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. These numbers are not just statistics. They are families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><h2 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h2><p>The violence does not pause. In January, a boy was struck and killed at an intersection by an SUV. Days later, an elderly man died crossing the street. The year before, a motorcyclist was thrown from his bike and died on Skidmore Avenue. Each time, the street is washed clean, but the loss remains.</p><p>When a police chase ended with a Jeep on the L train tracks, a witness <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/driver-fleeing-cops-brooklyn-subway-station/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;Next thing I know, he was into the fence. Absolutely crazy.&rdquo; The chaos is not rare. It is routine.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h2><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. But the carnage continues. After a high-speed pursuit ended in death near the Belt Parkway, a local resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/belt-parkway-brooklyn-nypd-shooting/>counted the sirens</a>: &ldquo;30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that&rsquo;s insane.&rdquo; The response is always after the fact.</p><p>City leaders have the power to lower speed limits and redesign streets. They have passed laws, but action is slow. Each day of delay is another day of risk for the people who walk, bike, and wait at the curb.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The police in Precinct 69 can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. Residents can demand action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>Act now. The next victim is only a matter of time.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
