Bikes and mopeds are in the count too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>.</li><li>Nights are cruel.

The bus operator and three passengers were unhurt, reporters said. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7</a>. amNY reported, citing the MTA, that “the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>.</p><p>What the precinct can do now</p><ul><li>Target left‑turn risk where people walk: Forest Ave at Union; Ring Rd at Richmond Hill Rd. Daylight the corners, add leading pedestrian intervals, and harden the turns.</li><li>Treat heavy vehicles as a threat vector. Focus inspections and enforcement on truck routes and loading at Forest Ave and along Richmond Ave.</li><li>Work the hours that kill. If 10 PM is the worst hour, be there.</li></ul><p>Citywide fixes that backstop every block</p><ul><li>Slow the city down. The data are blunt: speed kills. New York has the authority to set safer limits and the case has already been made. See our evidence and how to push for a <strong>20 MPH default</strong> <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</li><li>Stop the worst repeat offenders. Vehicles racking up camera tickets are far more likely to maim and kill; the proposed <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would force speed‑limiting tech on the most dangerous drivers. Details and call scripts are <a href=/take_action/>here</a>. As advocates have documented, “vehicles that rack up 16 speed‑ or red‑light‑camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure,” and <strong>30+ tickets</strong> multiplies the risk fifty‑fold. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog</a>.</li></ul><p>Who’s on the hook</p><p>This is Police Precinct 121, represented by Council Member <a href=/council-district/51/>Frank Morano</a>, Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/61/>Charles Fall</a>, and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/23/>Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</a>.
