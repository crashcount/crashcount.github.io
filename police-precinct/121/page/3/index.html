Nineteen more have been seriously injured.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age or time of day. They only climb.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed on College Avenue. The police said he &ldquo;suffered head trauma as a result of the crash&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>). No arrests. The investigation drags on. The street stays the same.</p><p>In May, a 58-year-old man was crossing Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma,&rdquo; police <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>reported</a>. He died at the hospital. The driver survived. No charges. No answers.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. Cars and trucks do the killing: four deaths by truck or bus, two by car, one by van. Motorcycles and mopeds leave bodies and broken bones. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not wrapped in steel.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras run 24/7. The law now allows lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. Streets wait for redesign. Enforcement comes in bursts, then fades. The police can act. They can ticket speeders, crack down on failure to yield, target known danger zones. They know where the bodies fall. They just need to care.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-ours>The Next Step Is Ours</h3><p><strong>Every death here could have been stopped.</strong> The blood on the street is not fate. It is policy. It is delay. It is silence.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safer streets.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
