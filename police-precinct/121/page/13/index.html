Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars—some seen, some not. In the last year alone, one person died, and 333 were injured. One was a worker at the Amazon warehouse, run down by a box truck in the dark. He had two daughters. He did not go home. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/10/man-34-killed-reversing-truck-staten-island-amazon-warehouse/>“He was 34 years old. He had two daughters. He was killed on the job,”</a> said a coworker. The driver stayed. No charges. The case sits with the Collision Investigation Squad. The family waits.</p><h3 id=the-police-power-and-responsibility>The Police: Power and Responsibility</h3><p><strong>Precinct 121 has the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people die. But the grind continues. In the last year, 573 crashes. One death. Six left with life-changing wounds. The city talks about cracking down. The mayor stands by as mopeds are crushed. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>“New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights,”</a> said Mayor Adams. The city boasts of removing 62,000 illegal vehicles. But the streets are still not safe for the ones on foot, on bikes, or waiting for the bus.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have power.</strong> They can push for lower speed limits. They can demand more speed cameras. They can fund street redesigns. They can hold the police to account. But too often, they wait. The law lets the city set safer speeds. The city can act now. Every day of delay is another risk, another family changed forever.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next: Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
