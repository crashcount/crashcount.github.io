Vehicles racking up camera tickets are far more likely to maim and kill; the proposed <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would force speed‑limiting tech on the most dangerous drivers. Details and call scripts are <a href=/take_action/>here</a>. As advocates have documented, “vehicles that rack up 16 speed‑ or red‑light‑camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure,” and <strong>30+ tickets</strong> multiplies the risk fifty‑fold. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog</a>.</li></ul><p>Who’s on the hook</p><p>This is Police Precinct 121, represented by Council Member <a href=/council-district/51/>Frank Morano</a>, Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/61/>Charles Fall</a>, and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/23/>Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</a>.

The vehicle, a 2020 Hyundai sedan, was traveling south when it impacted the right front bumper. The report lists 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor. The driver was wearing a lap belt and harness and remained conscious after the crash. She sustained contusions and injuries to her elbow, lower arm, and hand. No driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding were noted.
