Vehicles racking up camera tickets are far more likely to maim and kill; the proposed <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would force speed‑limiting tech on the most dangerous drivers. Details and call scripts are <a href=/take_action/>here</a>. As advocates have documented, “vehicles that rack up 16 speed‑ or red‑light‑camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure,” and <strong>30+ tickets</strong> multiplies the risk fifty‑fold. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog</a>.</li></ul><p>Who’s on the hook</p><p>This is Police Precinct 121, represented by Council Member <a href=/council-district/51/>Frank Morano</a>, Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/61/>Charles Fall</a>, and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/23/>Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</a>.
