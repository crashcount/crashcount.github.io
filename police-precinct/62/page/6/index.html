An Audi, driven by a woman with a suspended license, struck them. Natasha Saada, Diana, and Debra died. Their brother, age four, is still in the hospital. The car had over 93 violations—20 for speeding, five for running red lights. The driver refused to speak to police, asking only for a lawyer. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/driver-accused-of-fatally-mowing-down-nyc-mom-kids-told-emts-she-had-the-devil-in-me-sources/>Dashcam footage of the Saturday afternoon crash shows the overturned Audi mowing down the family as they crossed the road, with several others injured in the crash.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 612 were injured</strong> in Precinct 62. Eight suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared—<strong>70 injured, none killed, but luck is not a strategy</strong>. Most victims were walking or crossing with the signal. The oldest killed was 95, the youngest injured just two.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In recent years, SUVs killed three pedestrians and trucks killed two. Cars, mopeds, bikes, and taxis all left people bleeding in the crosswalk. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in the road, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, New York can set its own speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. <strong>Speed cameras work—cutting speeding by 63% and injuries by 14%—but the law that keeps them on is always at risk of expiring.</strong></p><p>Police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. But the carnage continues. &ldquo;The suspect was somehow able to drive off the lot with the operator on board, making it down the block to 25th and Cropsey avenues, where he crashed into a parked car, police said.&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/20/us-news/scofflaw-hops-behind-wheel-of-mta-bus-at-nyc-depot-drives-off-with-operator-on-board-cops/>Police took the man into custody at the scene.</a></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand the police enforce the law.
