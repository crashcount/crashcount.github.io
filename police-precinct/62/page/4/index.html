The driver, Jumaane Wright, swerved toward officers, nearly striking a lieutenant, who fired a single shot. Wright crashed a mile later and died at the hospital.

Police say the driver, Menachem Shagalow, was unlicensed and charged with aggravated unlicensed operation, failure to exercise due care, and unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Brod died from her injuries at Maimonides Medical Center on April 20. The article notes, 'Menachem was arrested at 8:37 p.m. on April 8 shortly after the incident.' This crash follows another fatal collision involving a suspended driver in Brooklyn the previous week. The incidents highlight ongoing dangers from unlicensed drivers and raise questions about enforcement and systemic safety failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
