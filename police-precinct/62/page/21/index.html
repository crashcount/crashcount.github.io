They did not make it home. On March 29, 2025, a driver with a suspended license and a record of 93 violations, including 20 for speeding, plowed into Natasha Saada and her children. Diana was eight. Debra was five. Their brother, age four, is still fighting for his life. The car smashed into an Uber, then careened onto the sidewalk, crushing the family. The driver asked for a lawyer. The children did not get to ask for anything. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/driver-accused-of-fatally-mowing-down-nyc-mom-kids-told-emts-she-had-the-devil-in-me-sources/>Dashcam footage of the Saturday afternoon crash shows the overturned Audi mowing down the family as they crossed the road, with several others injured in the crash.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>Precinct 62 saw 990 crashes, 617 injuries, and one death</strong>. Eight people suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared: 69 under 18 were hurt. The oldest victim was 95. Most were hit at intersections. Most were walking.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-police-and-leaders>The Role of Police and Leaders</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. But the numbers do not lie. <strong>Crashes are up. Injuries are up.</strong></p><p>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They talk about cameras and lower speed limits. But action is slow. The city has the power to set safer speeds. It has not used it. The law is there. The will is not. As the mayor said, <a href=#citations>one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many</a>. But words do not stop cars.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Silence</h3><p>SUVs and trucks do the most harm. In the last three years, SUVs and cars killed three people and seriously injured five more. Trucks killed two. Bikes killed one. The dead are old and young. The pattern is clear. The response is not.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong></p><p>Ask for speed enforcement. Ask for failure-to-yield tickets. Ask for real protection at every crossing. <strong>Do not wait for another family to be broken.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
