The report states she was 'crossing with the signal.' The impact crushed her back, leaving her conscious but injured on the pavement as the traffic light cycled overhead. The police report does not list any contributing factors from the driver, but the narrative makes clear the driver failed to yield to a pedestrian who had the right of way. There is no mention of any pedestrian error or unsafe behavior; the victim was following the signal at the time of the crash. The incident underscores the persistent danger faced by people walking in city crosswalks, even when obeying traffic signals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
