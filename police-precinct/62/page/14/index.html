She died at the intersection, struck by a vehicle that ignored traffic controls. She was not the first. She will not be the last. In the past twelve months, <strong>three people have died and 767 have been injured</strong> in crashes in Precinct 62. Eight were seriously hurt. The dead are mostly older. The injured are everyone—children, workers, the old, the young.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, this precinct has seen <strong>10 deaths and 2,178 injuries</strong> from crashes. Cars and trucks did most of the killing—<strong>3 deaths and 324 injuries from SUVs alone</strong>. Trucks killed two more. Bikes and mopeds left their own mark. These numbers are not just statistics. They are mothers, fathers, sons, daughters. The city counts them. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The law gives police the power to enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target dangerous corners. But the carnage continues. The silence is loud. No recent statements. No new crackdowns. No word from the council or the mayor. The dead do not get a vote.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p>A man is killed crossing with the signal. A child is bruised at his side. The driver was distracted, failed to yield. The police report says it all: &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction. Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The story repeats.

The mayor can redesign streets. But nothing changes unless you demand it. Call your council member. Call the precinct.
