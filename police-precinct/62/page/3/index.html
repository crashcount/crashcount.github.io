Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> Nearly 2,000 injured since 2022. The dead are old and young. A 2-year-old girl, a 66-year-old woman, a 95-year-old crossing Cropsey Avenue. Each struck by a turning truck or SUV. Each left on the street, their stories ending at the curb.</p><p>The pain is not abstract. It is a son watching his father die on the pavement. “I see him on the floor,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. “His eyes were closed. I’m scared—I don’t know what to do.”</p><p><strong>Most victims are walking. Most drivers keep going.</strong> In one crash, a driver hit a man and <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>just kept going</a> as his son watched. In another, a woman crossing with the light was killed by a truck turning left. The police report reads: “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.”</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. Crackdowns on reckless driving.</strong> But change comes slow. The law lets the city set safer speeds. The precinct can target speeding, failure to yield, and known danger zones. They can act now. Too often, they wait.</p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for a <strong>20 mph default speed limit</strong>. They can back laws that stop repeat offenders. They can make sure enforcement targets the real danger—drivers, not the people on foot or bike.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-precinct-62>The Role of Precinct 62</h3><p>Precinct 62 can do more than write reports. They can enforce the law. They can make the next crash less likely. They can stop the next family from waiting at a hospital bed that will never warm again.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand real enforcement.</strong> Tell them the numbers are not just numbers. They are lives. They are neighbors. They are children and elders. Every day of delay is another risk, another family broken.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Demand safer streets now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the article, "Police say that officer fired one shot, striking the driver." The driver then crashed into an NYPD vehicle and later died at the hospital. A passenger was taken into custody. The incident drew a large police response, with one witness describing, "30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that's insane."
