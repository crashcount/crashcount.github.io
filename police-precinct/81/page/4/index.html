Seven are seriously hurt.</strong> In the past twelve months, 327 neighbors have been injured on the streets of Precinct 81. These numbers are not abstract—they are bodies broken on Broadway, Fulton, and Marcus Garvey. Children, elders, workers, and mothers. In three years, more than a thousand people have been hurt. <strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll. The violence is steady, relentless, and local.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 32-year-old woman was killed just before midnight on Van Buren Street. She was walking. She never made it home. Two SUVs and a sedan were involved. The street was quiet. The loss was not.

The Council can act. The Mayor can act. But the limit is still 25 mph. The silence is louder than the sirens. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. <strong>The police in Precinct 81 have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed, failure-to-yield, reckless driving. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the 81st Precinct. Demand lower speeds, more enforcement, and real protection for people who walk and bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
