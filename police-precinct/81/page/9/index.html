The vehicle's right front bumper took the impact, revealing a failure to avoid the pedestrian.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 1999 SUV traveling north on Lewis Avenue in Brooklyn struck a 9-year-old female pedestrian crossing the street outside a crosswalk. The impact occurred at the vehicle's right front bumper, causing contusions and bruising to the girl's hip and upper leg. The pedestrian was conscious at the scene and sustained injury severity level 3. The report lists no explicit contributing factors for the driver, but the collision with a pedestrian crossing without a signal or crosswalk indicates a failure to yield or properly observe the pedestrian. No driver errors such as speeding or impairment were noted, and the pedestrian's actions were unspecified as contributing factors. The incident underscores the danger posed by vehicles failing to detect or yield to pedestrians outside designated crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
