Seven are seriously hurt.</strong> In the past twelve months, 327 neighbors have been injured on the streets of Precinct 81. These numbers are not abstract—they are bodies broken on Broadway, Fulton, and Marcus Garvey. Children, elders, workers, and mothers. In three years, more than a thousand people have been hurt. <strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll. The violence is steady, relentless, and local.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 32-year-old woman was killed just before midnight on Van Buren Street. She was walking. She never made it home. Two SUVs and a sedan were involved. The street was quiet. The loss was not. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 63-year-old man died crossing Broadway at Myrtle. The driver was distracted. The man was gone before sunrise. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 12-year-old boy was hit on Quincy. A driver wasn’t paying attention.

The Council can act. The Mayor can act. But the limit is still 25 mph. The silence is louder than the sirens. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. <strong>The police in Precinct 81 have the tools.</strong> They can enforce speed, failure-to-yield, reckless driving. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the 81st Precinct. Demand lower speeds, more enforcement, and real protection for people who walk and bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.
