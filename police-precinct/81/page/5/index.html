Metal struck flesh. A 47-year-old woman on an e-scooter flew, body torn, blood pooling beneath the streetlamp. Shock and lacerations marked the aftermath. Driver inattention shaped the night’s violence.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a bus moved from its parked position near 1922 Fulton Street in Brooklyn at 22:10. An e-scooter, operated by a 47-year-old woman, was making a left turn when the collision occurred. The report states, 'A bus lunged from its parking spot. The e-scooter turned left. Metal struck flesh.' The woman was ejected from her scooter, sustaining severe lacerations and shock, with injuries to her entire body. The police report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The bus's center front end struck the left side doors of the e-scooter. The victim was unlicensed and unshielded, but the report does not cite these as contributing factors. The impact left her torn and shaking beneath a streetlamp, underscoring the consequences of driver inattention in a city street environment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
