A van door swings open. He hits the metal, falls, and a truck runs him down. His name is George Smaragdis. He dies at Bellevue. The van driver says, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>&ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo;</a> The truck driver stays at the scene. Police do not file charges. The street is quiet again.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>255 people have been injured in crashes in Precinct 1</strong>. Five were seriously hurt. One died. No age group is spared: children, elders, workers, tourists. The numbers are steady, the pain is not.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most harm</strong>—over 70 injuries to pedestrians. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds, taxis: all part of the count. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not safe.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>City Hall says, &ldquo;One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The mayor calls for safer streets. The police commissioner promises, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/02/biker-died-manhattan-identified-police/>&ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action.&rdquo;</a> The words are there. The danger remains.</p><p><strong>Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph.</strong> The law sits on the shelf. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired. No new plan yet.</p><h3 id=the-role-of-the-precinct>The Role of the Precinct</h3><p>Precinct 1 has the power. Officers can ticket speeders. They can target failure to yield. They can watch the corners where people bleed. They can act, or they can wait for the next crash.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy. It is enforcement. It is the will to act.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. Demand safe streets for the living, not just memorials for the dead.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The collision's primary contributing factors were 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely,' both driver errors that precipitated the crash. An 86-year-old female passenger, seated in the middle front seat and restrained by a lap belt and harness, suffered head injuries and was in shock following the impact. The report notes she was not ejected but complained of pain and nausea. Vehicles were traveling northbound, with impacts occurring at the center front and back ends, indicating a rear-end collision sequence. The ambulance sustained damage to its left front bumper, while sedans showed damage to their center front and back ends. The report explicitly cites driver inattention and close following distances as causes, with no victim fault mentioned.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Both vehicles were traveling eastbound and going straight ahead when the crash happened. The bicyclist, a 36-year-old woman, was ejected from her bike and sustained contusions and injuries to her elbow, lower arm, and hand. The report cites 'Pavement Defective' and 'Pavement Slippery' as contributing factors, indicating hazardous road conditions played a role. The taxi driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead with no reported driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding. The bicyclist was not wearing safety equipment. Vehicle damage was minimal, but the impact caused significant injury to the cyclist. The report highlights systemic danger from road surface conditions rather than driver misconduct.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The narrative notes she wore no helmet, but the police report does not list helmet use as a contributing factor. No other vehicles or driver errors are cited in the report. The data underscores the vulnerability of cyclists to equipment failure and the harsh consequences when infrastructure or machinery fails.
