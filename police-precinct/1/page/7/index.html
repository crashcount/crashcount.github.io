Thirteen left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, Precinct 1 saw 253 people injured and 4 seriously hurt in 618 crashes. The deadliest blows fall on those with nothing but skin and hope between them and the street—cyclists, pedestrians, children. In May, a man on an e-bike was thrown into the path of a truck after a van door swung open. He died on Broome Street. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo;</a> The fire crew tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>&ldquo;I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,&rdquo;</a> said a witness named Paul.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools. The precinct has the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands. Speed cameras slash speeding by more than half, but their future is always in doubt. The police can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They can act—if they choose to see the problem.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure.</strong> The numbers do not lie. Cars and trucks caused most of the pain—74 injuries to pedestrians, 4 serious. Bikes and mopeds left their own mark. The police must enforce the law. The city must lower the speed. The state must keep the cameras on. The time for speeches is over. The time for action is now.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speeds, more enforcement, and streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The street swallowed her pain.</p><p class=mb3>A 27-year-old woman suffered severe lacerations to her leg when her bicycle broke at the front while riding straight on Washington Street near Canal, according to the police report. The report describes how her 'bike broke at the front,' causing her to sustain a deep leg wound and enter a state of shock, with 'blood pooled on the pavement.' The narrative notes she wore no helmet, but the police report does not list helmet use as a contributing factor. No other vehicles or driver errors are cited in the report. The data underscores the vulnerability of cyclists to equipment failure and the harsh consequences when infrastructure or machinery fails. The city moved on as she lay injured, her pain unnoticed by the passing world.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a 2022 SUV, traveling east and making a right turn, struck her on the right side doors. The pedestrian sustained abrasions and injuries to her elbow, lower arm, and hand. The report identifies the driver’s maneuver—making a right turn—as the pre-crash action leading to the impact. No contributing factors were attributed to the pedestrian, who was crossing lawfully. The collision caused damage to the right side doors of the vehicle. The police report lists unspecified contributing factors but highlights the driver’s failure to avoid the pedestrian during the turn as the critical cause of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
