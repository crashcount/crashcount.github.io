Afternoon swells. Night does not spare us: injuries spike around noon and again into the evening, with steady harm even at 8 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Canal Street: speed and the dead</p><ul><li>On July 19, a driver in a stolen car went more than 100 mph off the Manhattan Bridge and hit at Bowery and Canal. Two people died. The city said it would move fast: “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). NY1 named the victims, Kevin Cruickshank and May Kwok, and reported the alleged speed at “more than 100 miles per hour” (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>).</li><li>Advocates warned the fixes were a start, not an end. “Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block,” said Ben Furnas. “The vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>Prosecutors moved. “Two women charged in connection with a deadly crash in Chinatown have now been indicted” (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-women-indicted-in-deadly-chinatown-crash/>CBS New York</a>).</li></ul><p>Who gets hit, where the harm lands</p><ul><li>Peak hours in this precinct hurt: injuries pile up around midday (noon to 2 p.m.) and again from the commute into night. Even at midnight there are <strong>40 injuries</strong> in the dataset’s tally, and at 10 a.m. there is the lone death recorded in the period summary (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Among pedestrians, cars and SUVs do most of the damage, with taxis, buses, bikes, and trucks also in the count.

Daylight the curbs on West Street and Broadway. Harden the turns. Give walkers an early start at the lights. Protect the bike lanes where the bodies are.</li><li>At Canal and Bowery, extend barriers through the corridor, not just the corner. Narrow the lanes. Post and enforce lower speeds where the deaths fell (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>).</li></ul><p>Citywide levers that matter here</p><ul><li><strong>Lower speeds save lives.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. New York City now has the power to lower limits. A citywide 20 mph default would backstop every bad corner. Our site explains how and who to call in our <a href=/take_action/>action guide</a>.</li><li>A few drivers do outsized harm. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the worst repeat offenders to use tech that keeps them near the limit. The case for it, and who to press, is in <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>What will it take</p><ul><li>West Street still racks up injuries. Broadway too. Canal took two lives in a flash. The night hours keep filling the ledger. The fixes are not secrets. They are paint, posts, timing, and will.</li><li>Do one thing today. Then another tomorrow.
