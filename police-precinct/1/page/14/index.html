Thirteen left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, Precinct 1 saw 253 people injured and 4 seriously hurt in 618 crashes. The deadliest blows fall on those with nothing but skin and hope between them and the street—cyclists, pedestrians, children. In May, a man on an e-bike was thrown into the path of a truck after a van door swung open. He died on Broome Street. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo;</a> The fire crew tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>&ldquo;I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,&rdquo;</a> said a witness named Paul.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools. The precinct has the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands. Speed cameras slash speeding by more than half, but their future is always in doubt. The police can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They can act—if they choose to see the problem.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure.</strong> The numbers do not lie. Cars and trucks caused most of the pain—74 injuries to pedestrians, 4 serious. Bikes and mopeds left their own mark. The police must enforce the law. The city must lower the speed. The state must keep the cameras on. The time for speeches is over. The time for action is now.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speeds, more enforcement, and streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
