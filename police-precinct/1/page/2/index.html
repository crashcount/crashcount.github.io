Thirteen left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, Precinct 1 saw 253 people injured and 4 seriously hurt in 618 crashes. The deadliest blows fall on those with nothing but skin and hope between them and the street—cyclists, pedestrians, children. In May, a man on an e-bike was thrown into the path of a truck after a van door swung open. He died on Broome Street. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo;</a> The fire crew tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>&ldquo;I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,&rdquo;</a> said a witness named Paul.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city has the tools. The precinct has the power.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands. Speed cameras slash speeding by more than half, but their future is always in doubt. The police can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They can act—if they choose to see the problem.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure.</strong> The numbers do not lie. Cars and trucks caused most of the pain—74 injuries to pedestrians, 4 serious. Bikes and mopeds left their own mark. The police must enforce the law. The city must lower the speed. The state must keep the cameras on. The time for speeches is over. The time for action is now.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand lower speeds, more enforcement, and streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation aims to allow only buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off quickly. The M34 bus, used by 28,000 daily riders, currently averages just 3 mph during rush hour. Officials cite the 2019 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24% and reduced crash injuries. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks. The move follows previous controversies over similar projects but reflects a push for safer, more efficient streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

The article states, "NYPD sources said the two officers in pursuit returned to their stationhouse without reporting the crash." The FDNY later found Guzman Parra dead in the burning car. Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim." The officers remain on leave as both the NYPD and the New York attorney general's office investigate. The case raises questions about police pursuit protocols and reporting failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bicyclist sustained abrasions to the face and was conscious at the scene. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. The bicyclist was operating the bike westbound, going straight ahead, and was not ejected from the vehicle. The report also notes a secondary contributing factor listed as 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion,' but the primary cause remains the driver's distraction. The bike showed no damage, indicating the impact was likely minor in vehicle terms but significant enough to cause injury to the vulnerable rider. No safety equipment was used by the bicyclist, but this was not cited as a contributing factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
