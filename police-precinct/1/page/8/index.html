Daylight the curbs on West Street and Broadway. Harden the turns. Give walkers an early start at the lights.

The crash occurred at 9:30 p.m. The report describes, 'A Tesla slammed into a parked taxi. Steel crumpled. The 35-year-old driver was trapped, crushed in the cab.' Emergency responders arrived as the street stood silent, pierced only by sirens and the sound of twisted metal. The taxi driver, a 35-year-old man, suffered crush injuries and was not ejected from the vehicle. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The data shows the taxi was parked and the Tesla was traveling straight ahead before the impact. No driver errors are explicitly named in the report, but the sequence of events centers on the moving vehicle colliding with a stationary one, leaving the vulnerable driver trapped in the aftermath.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Both pedestrians, a 67-year-old woman and a 72-year-old man, were crossing without a signal and sustained abrasions and injuries to their limbs, including elbow, lower arm, hand, knee, lower leg, and foot. The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor attributed to the driver. The pedestrians were conscious and injured but not ejected. The vehicle showed no damage despite the impact on its left front quarter panel. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the driver’s failure to yield was the critical cause of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
