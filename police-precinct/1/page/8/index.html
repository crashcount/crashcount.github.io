But the blood still runs. In the last twelve months, 278 people were hurt in crashes here. Five were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>Last August, an 11-year-old girl was cut across the face by an e-scooter on South Street. The crash report lists &ldquo;unsafe speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;aggressive driving.&rdquo; She was not in the roadway. She was just there.</p><p>A city worker fixing a sign on Broadway was slashed by a cyclist after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a>. The worker bled in the street. The cyclist fled. No arrest.</p><p>A van crashed in Midtown. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline inside. A woman and her child sat in a parked car, struck by a runaway food cart. They went to the hospital. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The air stank of fuel. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Cars and SUVs hurt the most. In three years, they injured 180 people here. Trucks and buses, 23. Motorcycles and mopeds, 9. Bikes, 20. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p>The city lowered speed limits near schools. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the carnage continues. Police crack down on &ldquo;ghost cars&rdquo; and reckless drivers. Yet the streets stay dangerous for the ones on foot, on bikes, at work.</p><p>When police and leaders act, people live. When they wait, people bleed. The tools are there: speed enforcement, failure-to-yield tickets, targeting crash hotspots. The will is not always there.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safe crossings. Demand action before the next child, the next worker, the next neighbor is hurt.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
