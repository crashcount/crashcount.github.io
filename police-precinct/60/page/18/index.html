She is ninety-five. She has survived Nazis, Chernobyl, and COVID. A cargo van turns left. She does not survive the street. Her home health aide is hurt. The driver is not charged. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>remembers her as &ldquo;a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The city moves on.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 423 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes in Precinct 60. Three suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared. One child died. Thirty-nine more were hurt. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-bodies>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, they killed two, seriously injured two, and left 78 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses hurt eight. Motorcycles and bikes add to the count. No one is safe. Not the young. Not the old.

They just need to act.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. Demand that Precinct 60 use every tool to protect the people who walk and ride. Do not wait for the next name. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
