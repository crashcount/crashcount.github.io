She is ninety-five. She has survived Nazis, Chernobyl, and COVID. A cargo van turns left. She does not survive the street. Her home health aide is hurt. The driver is not charged. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>remembers her as &ldquo;a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The city moves on.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 423 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes in Precinct 60. Three suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared. One child died. Thirty-nine more were hurt. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-bodies>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, they killed two, seriously injured two, and left 78 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses hurt eight. Motorcycles and bikes add to the count. No one is safe. Not the young. Not the old. Not the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><p>A <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/30/us-news/driver-of-stolen-porsche-shot-dead-by-cops-after-attempting-to-evade-roadblock-and-nearly-hitting-officer-nypd/>police shooting</a> at a roadblock near the Belt Parkway ends with a dead driver.

They just need to act.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. Demand that Precinct 60 use every tool to protect the people who walk and ride. Do not wait for the next name. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city had announced the removal would happen by the end of June. The order blocks any changes until a court hearing on August 6. According to NY1, the restraining order 'prevents the city from altering three blocks of a protected lane along Bedford Avenue, on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and South Williamsburg.' The case highlights the tension between city policy and street safety for vulnerable road users. No driver actions are cited, but the move would have reduced protection for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists lose shield. Children dart from double-parked cars. Community complaints drive policy. Streets stay chaotic. Power struggles linger. Riders and walkers face new risk. Steel yields to politics.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams ordered the removal of protective barriers from a stretch of Brooklyn’s Bedford Avenue bike lane. The move follows complaints from local residents, especially after a viral video showed a child running into the lane from a double-parked car and colliding with an e-bike. Adams stated, 'we listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback.' The Department of Transportation will revert the protected lane to its previous unprotected state between Willoughby and Flushing avenues. The article highlights ongoing political battles over street design and notes that double-parking and chaotic traffic remain unaddressed. Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro cited 'lack of action' on e-bike safety as a barrier to safer infrastructure. The decision removes a key safety measure for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One cyclist, Robert Hillebrand, suffered a severed windpipe and required blood transfusions. Another, Jennifer Noble, received stitches and a broken finger. Police said the string was likely from kite fighting, a practice where glass-coated strings are used to cut opponents' kites. Witnesses described a yellow nylon string stretched across the bike lane. The NYPD found no criminality. The city parks department bans kite fighting but enforcement is lacking. Danny Mundy, a local civic leader, said, “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable.” Previous injuries and lawsuits linked to kite string in the area highlight ongoing risks for cyclists and wildlife. No driver involvement was reported, but the incident exposes gaps in infrastructure and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street stayed silent.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 25, 2025, that a 32-year-old woman was killed after a minor collision near Van Buren St. and Marcus Garvey Blvd. in Brooklyn. After the initial crash, the Chevy Trax driver struck the woman as she exited her vehicle, then drove against traffic on Lafayette Ave., hitting two parked cars before fleeing on foot. Witness Shane Bridges described, "They dragged her like to the middle of the street, and then they turned wrong up Lafayette and she was just left there." The SUV had temporary paper plates. The incident highlights the dangers posed by reckless driving and hit-and-run behavior, especially when drivers ignore traffic direction and abandon crash scenes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
