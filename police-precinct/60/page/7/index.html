Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,300 injured since 2022. The dead do not get second chances. The wounded carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>The last three years have seen bodies in the crosswalk, on the curb, in the road. <strong>A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed by an SUV turning on Neptune Avenue.</strong> A 45-year-old man, struck dead at the intersection of Ocean Parkway and Neptune Avenue. A teenager, helmet on, killed riding a motorcycle on the Belt Parkway. Each one a life ended, a family broken. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><h3 id=reckless-driving-reckless-loss>Reckless Driving, Reckless Loss</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>Cars and SUVs cause most of the harm</strong>—over 250 crashes, two deaths, and three serious injuries. Trucks and buses add more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. The streets are not safe for those on foot or on two wheels.</p><p>The stories repeat. A driver loses control. A car turns left, a cyclist goes down. A pedestrian steps off the curb and never makes it to the other side. <strong>&ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said the driver</a>. <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said her sister-in-law</a>. The grief does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuses>Leadership: Action or Excuses?</h3><p>The police in Precinct 60 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the corners where people die. But the carnage continues. <strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong></p><p>Local leaders have the power to demand more. They can push for lower speed limits, more daylighted intersections, and real crackdowns on repeat offenders. They can refuse to let another family mourn alone. But silence is easy. Action is hard.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is a choice.</strong> Every death is preventable. The police can act. The politicians can act. The people can act. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
