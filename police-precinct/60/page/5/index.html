She is ninety-five. She has survived Nazis, Chernobyl, and COVID. A cargo van turns left. She does not survive the street. Her home health aide is hurt. The driver is not charged. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>remembers her as &ldquo;a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The city moves on.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 423 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes in Precinct 60. Three suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared. One child died. Thirty-nine more were hurt. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-bodies>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, they killed two, seriously injured two, and left 78 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses hurt eight. Motorcycles and bikes add to the count. No one is safe. Not the young. Not the old.

They just need to act.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. Demand that Precinct 60 use every tool to protect the people who walk and ride. Do not wait for the next name. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the NYPD, she was "riding in a black Cadillac traveling southbound in the middle lane" before she got out. A gray Chevrolet, also southbound but in the right lane, struck her. Both drivers remained at the scene. No arrests have been made. The NYPD Highway Collision Investigation Squad continues to review the crash. The incident highlights the risks faced by passengers exiting vehicles on busy city streets, and underscores the dangers of multi-lane traffic corridors where vulnerable road users must navigate fast-moving cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 2024 Toyota taxi was traveling straight south when it collided with a 2024 Mazda SUV making a right turn. The point of impact was the taxi's right front bumper and the SUV's left front bumper. The SUV had one occupant, a 73-year-old female passenger seated in the left rear, who was injured with knee, lower leg, and foot trauma and experienced shock and complaints of pain or nausea. She was secured with a lap belt and harness and was not ejected. The taxi had two occupants, including the male licensed driver. The report does not specify contributing factors or driver errors, but the collision involved conflicting vehicle movements—straight travel versus a right turn—indicating potential failure to yield or right-of-way errors by one or both drivers.
