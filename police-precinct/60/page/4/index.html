She is ninety-five. She has survived Nazis, Chernobyl, and COVID. A cargo van turns left. She does not survive the street. Her home health aide is hurt. The driver is not charged. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>remembers her as &ldquo;a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The city moves on.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and 423 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes in Precinct 60. Three suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared. One child died. Thirty-nine more were hurt. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-bodies>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, they killed two, seriously injured two, and left 78 with moderate wounds.

They just need to act.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand real enforcement. Demand that Precinct 60 use every tool to protect the people who walk and ride. Do not wait for the next name. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brod died from her injuries at Maimonides Medical Center on April 20. The article notes, 'Menachem was arrested at 8:37 p.m. on April 8 shortly after the incident.' This crash follows another fatal collision involving a suspended driver in Brooklyn the previous week.

Saada’s 4-year-old son was critically injured. Prosecutors allege Yarimi drove with a suspended license, ran two red lights, and floored her Audi to 68 mph in a 25 mph zone before striking the family as they crossed Ocean Parkway. District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst' crashes he has seen, stating, 'This defendant’s unconscionably dangerous driving wiped out a family.' Five Uber passengers also sustained minor injuries. Yarimi was held without bail and faces up to 15 years if convicted. The case underscores the lethal risks of reckless driving and gaps in license enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The February collision killed his 26-year-old passenger, Imani Vance, and injured the bus driver. According to the Brooklyn DA, Epps "ignored a stop sign and drove at excessive speeds," then left the scene by calling an Uber, abandoning his injured passenger. The impact pushed the bus into a third, empty vehicle. No children on the bus were harmed. Epps was apprehended after fleeing on foot. The case highlights persistent dangers at intersections and the lethal consequences of ignoring traffic controls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require speed-limiting technology for drivers with repeated offenses—those with 11 or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year. Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, citing the crash, demand action: 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair... it’s time for us to act.'

Police say a Toyota Camry, turning right, was rear-ended by an Audi sedan. The impact pushed the Camry aside, and the Audi continued forward, striking the family in a crosswalk before overturning. The Audi's driver, Miriam Yarimi, 32, was arrested and charged with manslaughter. Police said she was driving on a suspended license. Investigators are examining whether she ran a red light or was speeding. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road.' The incident highlights ongoing risks for pedestrians and questions about enforcement of license suspensions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
