On 2025-03-14 an SUV struck and killed a 78-year-old at Northern Boulevard and Parsons Boulevard. On 2024-06-10 a 63-year-old bicyclist died at Bowne Street and 41st Avenue after a left-turning SUV. On 2024-03-06 a 63-year-old moped rider died at College Point Boulevard and Blossom Avenue in a left-turn crash. On 2024-02-15 a 68-year-old woman was killed on Main Street near Reeves Avenue; the report lists unsafe speed. The record is public and long.</p><p>Since 2022: 23 dead, 90 seriously hurt, 3,424 injured, across 6,290 crashes, per NYC Open Data.</p><h3 id=where-it-keeps-happening>Where it keeps happening</h3><p>Highways and arterials carry the blood. Cross Island Parkway is a top hotspot (1 death, 10 serious injuries). Whitestone Expressway is another (2 deaths, 7 serious injuries). Northern Boulevard also kills (2 deaths, 3 serious injuries). These corridors cut through the 109.</p><p>Nights are worst. The deadliest hour is 9 p.m. (4 deaths). Seven to ten p.m. account for a cluster of fatal crashes. Poor lighting and late-night speeding make a deadly mix. Targeted night enforcement and better lighting would help.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage. City data show 696 car/SUV crashes and 10 related deaths; trucks and buses account for far fewer incidents.</p><h3 id=queens-voices>Queens voices</h3><p>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said. Lee told police he entered the Clearview Expressway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done.” Those words hang over every ramp and merge.</p><h3 id=what-the-109-can-do-now>What the 109 can do now</h3><p>This is fixable. Run night speed details from 7–10 p.m. Flood Cross Island Parkway and Whitestone Expressway ramps with targeted enforcement. Treat repeat hotspots as repeat problems: log them and return. Add Leading Pedestrian Intervals and daylighting at failure-to-yield corners like Bowne St & 41st Ave and College Point Blvd & Blossom Ave. Harden left turns. Use traffic-calming on arterial approaches.</p><h3 id=city-hall-and-albany--the-bigger-fixes>City Hall and Albany — the bigger fixes</h3><p>Local crashes point to citywide choices. New York must set a safer default: lower the citywide speed limit to 20 mph. Albany and the Legislature should require intelligent speed-assistance devices for habitual speeders. Use Sammy’s Law and the Stop Super Speeders proposals to push these changes; they are concrete, enforceable remedies. For ways to act locally and at the state level, see Take Action.</p><p>No more names on a spreadsheet. Call your council member, your state reps, and the mayor. Show up at hearings. Demand 20 mph and limits on repeat speeders. Don’t let tonight be the worst hour again.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
