Thirty-eight suffered serious injuries. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. In three and a half years, 22 people have been killed and over 3,000 injured on these streets. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The violence is relentless. In March, a 78-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV on Parsons Boulevard. She was not at an intersection. She did not stand a chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> In June, a 63-year-old woman riding her bike was killed by a left-turning SUV on Bowne Street.

The NYPD <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/05/fiery-bmw-crash-on-queens-highway-leaves-2-in-critical-condition/>said, &ldquo;their out-of-control luxury car vaulted into oncoming traffic&mldr; slamming into two unsuspecting motorists in a fiery crash.&rdquo;</a> Two died. Others survived, but not unchanged. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>BMW Crash Kills Two on Belt Parkway</a></p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven’t</h3><p>City and state leaders have taken steps. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Speed cameras have been renewed. But the pace is slow. Precinct 109 still sees death and injury, week after week.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They can make it clear: no more excuses, no more waiting.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action. Every day without change is another day someone does not come home. The toll is not fate. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.
