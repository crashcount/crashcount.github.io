Main Street. College Point Boulevard. They carry the same news: impact, sirens, tape.</p><p><strong>Since 2022 in the 109th Precinct: 23 people killed and 3,468 injured across 6,354 crashes.</strong> SUVs and cars did most of the harm to people on foot. Ten killed, hundreds hurt. The tally is blunt: 702 pedestrian hits by passenger vehicles; 47 by trucks and buses. The rest by bikes and small motors. The hours flare at the edges of day. Deaths spike at 8 p.m., 9 p.m., and 9 p.m. again. Injuries stack from the school rush into the commute home. This is not a wave. It is a tide that never leaves. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data)</a></p><h3 id=where-the-street-wont-forgive>Where the street won’t forgive</h3><p>Cross Island Parkway. Whitestone Expressway. Northern Boulevard. Five deaths tied to these fast corridors, with hundreds hurt. They top the local hit list. The Cross Island shows 175 injuries and 10 serious injuries. The Whitestone shows 278 injuries and seven serious injuries. Northern Boulevard adds 141 injuries and two deaths. The map is simple: speed, merge, strike. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data)</a></p><p>On Main Street, a driver at unsafe speed struck and killed a 68‑year‑old woman off the crosswalk at Reeves Avenue. The car was going straight. She did not survive. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4702952)</a></p><p>On 41st Avenue at Bowne Street, a left‑turning SUV hit a 63‑year‑old woman on a bike. Head trauma. She died. The listed factor: driver inattention. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4731666)</a></p><p>On College Point Boulevard at Blossom Avenue, a Honda SUV turning left hit a 63‑year‑old woman on a motorized device. She was ejected and died. The factor: failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(CrashID 4707767)</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-speed-the-toll-is-human>The pattern is speed, the toll is human</h3><p>Unsafe speed appears in the death log. So does failure to yield. Together they mark lives cut short: 15 deaths tied to “other” driver causes, four to vulnerable user error, and one to failure to yield. The morning school hours hurt. The ride home hurts more. From 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., deaths land hour after hour, with 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. the hardest. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data)</a></p><p>A Queens case shows what a car can do when everything goes wrong. On the Clearview Expressway, Joseph Lee drove the wrong way and hit five cars. “You want to fight?” he said to a victim. He told police he entered the highway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done.” A jury convicted him. A judge gave him eight years. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>(amNY)</a></p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-slow-the-straights>Fix the turns, slow the straights</h3><p>Left turns kill here. Harden them. Give walkers a head start at signals. Cut sightline clutter at corners. Daylight the crosswalks. On Northern Boulevard and Main Street, that means space and seconds, not paint and hope. Target the peak hours when the body count climbs: school arrival, late commute, early night. Focus the hot spots: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Cross Island Parkway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Whitestone Expressway</a>, Northern, College Point. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data)</a></p><p>Trucks and buses are few but heavy. When they hit, the wounds run deep. Keep them off school blocks at the worst hours. Mark safer routes and enforce them where the data burns. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data)</a></p><h3 id=citywide-levers-local-lives>Citywide levers, local lives</h3><p>Speed is the hinge. A citywide drop saves lives. It is on the table now. The law exists. Use it. Lower the default limit on the streets where people walk. Pair it with real control of repeat speeders. A small group does outsize harm; the numbers bear it out. Intelligent speed assistance on the worst cars would cap the damage. <a href=/take_action/>(Take Action)</a></p><p>“Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set safer speeds,” the call script says. “Lower our residential speed limit to 20 mph citywide.” The campaign also backs devices for drivers who pile up tickets, to stop them at +5 mph over the limit. <a href=/take_action/>(Take Action)</a></p><p>The names on the 109th are spare in the data. The hours are not. Eight p.m. comes. Nine p.m. comes. The sirens do too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>(NYC Open Data)</a></p><p>—</p><p>One thing you can do: push the city to slow the streets and stop the worst repeat speeders.
