The MTA pulled him from service. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; said a witness. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York coverage</a></p><p><strong>Local leaders can act.</strong> They can demand lower speed limits, more enforcement, and safer street design.
