Seventy-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 3,000 hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are elders crossing Northern Boulevard. They are children struck on their way home. They are cyclists, pinned and ejected, their bikes twisted in the gutter.</p><p>A 78-year-old woman tried to cross Northern Boulevard. A dark minivan hit her and kept going. She died at the hospital. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> &ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo; No arrest. No justice. Just another name lost.</p><p>On 32nd Avenue, a car pinned a man beneath its weight. A child, eight or ten, was hit too. The man was critical. The child went to the hospital. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>Police responded</a> and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.</p><p><strong>Most of the killing is done by cars and SUVs.</strong> Sedans and SUVs alone are behind 10 of the deaths and 24 of the most serious injuries to pedestrians here. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds—they all play their part, but the weight of the harm is steel and speed.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets leaders lower speed limits to 20 mph. Speed cameras can run all day, all night. But change is slow. The council and mayor have the power to act. They have not used it yet. Every day of delay is another risk, another family waiting for a call that will break them.</p><p>The police in Precinct 109 have the means. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the crosswalk. They just need to act like it matters.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone, or by a city that refuses to act. If you live here, call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand lower speed limits. Demand enforcement. Demand that the police treat every death as a crime, not a cost of doing business.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
