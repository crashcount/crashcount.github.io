The MTA pulled him from service. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; said a witness. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York coverage</a></p><p><strong>Local leaders can act.</strong> They can demand lower speed limits, more enforcement, and safer street design.

The SUV, driven by a licensed male driver, was starting from a parking position traveling north when it struck the e-bike from behind. The point of impact was the SUV’s center front end hitting the e-bike’s center back end. The e-bike rider, a 45-year-old man, was injured with a concussion and back injury, and was found unconscious. The report lists unspecified contributing factors but does not identify any fault or errors by the e-bike rider. The SUV driver’s action of pulling out from parking and colliding with the e-bike indicates a failure to yield or lack of awareness of the vulnerable road user.
