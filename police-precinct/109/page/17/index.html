On 2025-03-14 an SUV struck and killed a 78-year-old at Northern Boulevard and Parsons Boulevard. On 2024-06-10 a 63-year-old bicyclist died at Bowne Street and 41st Avenue after a left-turning SUV. On 2024-03-06 a 63-year-old moped rider died at College Point Boulevard and Blossom Avenue in a left-turn crash.

Cross Island Parkway is a top hotspot (1 death, 10 serious injuries). Whitestone Expressway is another (2 deaths, 7 serious injuries). Northern Boulevard also kills (2 deaths, 3 serious injuries). These corridors cut through the 109.</p><p>Nights are worst. The deadliest hour is 9 p.m. (4 deaths). Seven to ten p.m. account for a cluster of fatal crashes. Poor lighting and late-night speeding make a deadly mix. Targeted night enforcement and better lighting would help.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.

Run night speed details from 7–10 p.m. Flood Cross Island Parkway and Whitestone Expressway ramps with targeted enforcement. Treat repeat hotspots as repeat problems: log them and return. Add Leading Pedestrian Intervals and daylighting at failure-to-yield corners like Bowne St & 41st Ave and College Point Blvd & Blossom Ave. Harden left turns. Use traffic-calming on arterial approaches.</p><h3 id=city-hall-and-albany--the-bigger-fixes>City Hall and Albany — the bigger fixes</h3><p>Local crashes point to citywide choices. New York must set a safer default: lower the citywide speed limit to 20 mph. Albany and the Legislature should require intelligent speed-assistance devices for habitual speeders. Use Sammy’s Law and the Stop Super Speeders proposals to push these changes; they are concrete, enforceable remedies. For ways to act locally and at the state level, see Take Action.</p><p>No more names on a spreadsheet. Call your council member, your state reps, and the mayor. Show up at hearings. Demand 20 mph and limits on repeat speeders.

The report states the man was crossing without a signal when the SUV, traveling straight ahead, hit him with its right front bumper. The pedestrian suffered severe head lacerations and remained conscious, lying still on the pavement. Blood pooled at the scene. The SUV bore no visible damage. Police list the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both driver and pedestrian. The report notes the pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but does not cite this as a contributing factor.
