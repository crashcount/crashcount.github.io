The bus, a 2016 New Flyer, showed no damage and its driver was uninjured. The report makes no mention of any victim behavior contributing to the crash.

The boy suffered crush injuries to his entire body but remained conscious at the scene. The report notes the SUV sustained no damage. The collision occurred as the boy was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' and not at an intersection. The police report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any explicit driver error such as 'Failure to Yield.' The narrative underscores that 'the street offered no protection.' The focus remains on the impact and the lack of systemic safeguards for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The narrative states, 'A Ford pickup rolled west. A 53-year-old woman stepped into the street, outside the crosswalk. Metal struck flesh. Her body broke beneath the weight. She lay conscious, crushed from head to toe.' The report lists the pedestrian's injuries as 'crush injuries' to her entire body, with the victim remaining conscious after impact. The police data records the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian, offering no details on specific driver errors or external conditions. The point of impact was the right side doors of the truck, which continued straight ahead. The report notes the pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal force of the vehicle and the systemic exposure of pedestrians to danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
