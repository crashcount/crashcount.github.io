Seventy-seven left with serious wounds.</strong> Nearly 3,000 injured since 2022. The old and the young fall alike. Two children killed. Four elders over 75, gone. The street does not care who you are.</p><p>A 78-year-old woman tried to cross Northern Boulevard. She did not make it. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> she was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street. The driver did not stop. Her name was not released. The story is always the same. The street stays hungry.</p><p>At 32nd Avenue and 138th Street, a car hit a man and a child. The man was pinned under the car. The child was sent to the hospital. Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>responded and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle</a>. The driver stayed. The pain did not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Ten killed by cars and SUVs. Nineteen left with serious injuries. Trucks and buses, three more serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. Bikes, none killed, but eight hurt badly. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies in the street.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>The city has the tools. Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. The power to act. But action comes slow. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city can do it now. It has not. Cameras catch speeders, but the law to keep them running is always at risk. The police can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target the corners where people die. They can write the tickets. They just need to know it matters.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more-than-words>What Next: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, keep the cameras on, and make the police enforce the law. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the collision occurred at 6:40 a.m. The pedestrian suffered severe lacerations to his head, with blood visible on the street, but remained conscious at the scene. The driver of the Audi did not stop after the impact. The police narrative notes the pedestrian was crossing without a signal, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor to the crash. Instead, both contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified.' The driver’s failure to remain at the scene stands out as a critical failure in duty and responsibility.
