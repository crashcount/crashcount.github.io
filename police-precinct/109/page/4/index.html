The MTA pulled him from service. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; said a witness. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York coverage</a></p><p><strong>Local leaders can act.</strong> They can demand lower speed limits, more enforcement, and safer street design.

Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area.
