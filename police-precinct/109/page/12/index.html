She did not make it. A dark minivan hit her and kept going. Police said, &ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>A man and a child, no older than ten, were hit at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street.

The street stayed dangerous. &ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, three people died on these streets.

The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed ten.

The law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act now. It has not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The police have the tools. They can enforce speed, failure to yield, reckless driving. They can target the places where people die. They just need to use them.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</p><p>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor.
