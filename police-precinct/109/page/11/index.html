Since 2022 in Precinct 109, at least <strong>10 pedestrians, 3 cyclists, and 2 riders of other small devices</strong> were killed; car occupants died too. Injuries number in the thousands. The clock keeps time. Death peaks after dark and again at the evening rush. The harm is steady through the day and surges around 5 to 9 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-road-turns-mean>Where the road turns mean</h3><p>Main Street. Northern Boulevard. College Point Boulevard. The bodies tell you where the danger lives. A 68‑year‑old woman walking on Main Street at Reeves Avenue was struck and killed. Police coded the crash with “Unsafe Speed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>. A 63‑year‑old woman on a bicycle at Bowne Street and 41st Avenue was hit by a left‑turning SUV and died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>. On College Point Boulevard at Blossom Avenue, a 63‑year‑old on a moped‑class device was struck by a left‑turning SUV and killed; the driver factor recorded was failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>.</p><p>The worst injury clusters track the big roads. The Cross Island Parkway. The Whitestone Expressway. Northern Boulevard. Each sits at the top of the precinct’s harm list. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-hours-that-cut>The hours that cut</h3><p>Night takes its share. Fatal crashes stack up in the evening and late night. Between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., deaths rise and serious injuries pile on. The 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. hours carry multiple deaths. So do 8 p.m., 7 p.m., and 6 p.m. The data marks more death at 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. than the dawn hours. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>.</p><h3 id=what-kills-here>What kills here</h3><p>Drivers’ actions dominate the ledger. “Other” driver factors lead the toll with 15 deaths alongside 1,321 injuries. Failure to yield appears again and again in turning crashes, with another death and 81 injuries. Distraction and alcohol trail behind but still maim. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><p>SUVs and sedans are the main blunt instruments. They account for the vast share of pedestrian injuries in this precinct. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>.</p><h3 id=one-voice-from-the-wreckage>One voice from the wreckage</h3><p>On the Clearview Expressway, a man drove the wrong way and hit car after car. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said after his conviction and eight‑year sentence. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. Lee told police why he entered the highway the wrong way: “because I wanted to hurt people.” <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-slow-the-straights>Fix the turns. Slow the straights.</h3><p>The pattern is plain. Left‑turn conflicts killed a cyclist at Bowne and 41st and a moped rider at College Point and Blossom. Failure to yield is named. Unsafe speed took a pedestrian on Main Street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>. Hardened centerlines, daylighted corners, and leading pedestrian intervals would hit these exact crash types. Target speed enforcement on Main Street and Northern Boulevard would meet the data where it bleeds. Focused patrols during the 6–10 p.m. window could catch the spikes. The Cross Island and Whitestone approaches need tighter access control where local streets feed the ramps. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-stop-the-next-name>Citywide moves that stop the next name</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city now has the power to set lower limits. A citywide 20 mph default on local streets would cut the force at impact. And the worst repeat speeders do outsized harm; speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up violations would keep them from topping the limit. Both steps are on the table. Push them. <a href=/take_action/>our explainer and call to action</a>.</p><p>Call it what it is. A slow grind of deaths on streets we all use. Names become numbers.

The point of impact was the right front bumper of the SUV and the left front bumper of the sedan. The report identifies failure to yield right-of-way as the key driver error contributing to the collision. A 12-year-old female occupant seated in the left rear passenger position of the SUV was injured, sustaining facial contusions and classified with injury severity level 3. She was wearing a lap belt and harness and was not ejected from the vehicle. The police report does not list any contributing factors related to the victim's behavior.

The 36-year-old male cyclist was injured in his elbow, lower arm, and hand, but remained conscious. The police report lists 'Driver Inexperience' twice as contributing factors, pointing to the sedan driver’s lack of skill as the main cause. The cyclist wore a helmet, as noted in the report.

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
