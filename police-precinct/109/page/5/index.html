Failure to yield appears again and again in turning crashes, with another death and 81 injuries. Distraction and alcohol trail behind but still maim. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><p>SUVs and sedans are the main blunt instruments. They account for the vast share of pedestrian injuries in this precinct. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>.</p><h3 id=one-voice-from-the-wreckage>One voice from the wreckage</h3><p>On the Clearview Expressway, a man drove the wrong way and hit car after car. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said after his conviction and eight‑year sentence. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. Lee told police why he entered the highway the wrong way: “because I wanted to hurt people.” <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-slow-the-straights>Fix the turns. Slow the straights.</h3><p>The pattern is plain. Left‑turn conflicts killed a cyclist at Bowne and 41st and a moped rider at College Point and Blossom. Failure to yield is named. Unsafe speed took a pedestrian on Main Street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>. Hardened centerlines, daylighted corners, and leading pedestrian intervals would hit these exact crash types. Target speed enforcement on Main Street and Northern Boulevard would meet the data where it bleeds. Focused patrols during the 6–10 p.m. window could catch the spikes. The Cross Island and Whitestone approaches need tighter access control where local streets feed the ramps. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-stop-the-next-name>Citywide moves that stop the next name</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city now has the power to set lower limits. A citywide 20 mph default on local streets would cut the force at impact. And the worst repeat speeders do outsized harm; speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up violations would keep them from topping the limit. Both steps are on the table. Push them. <a href=/take_action/>our explainer and call to action</a>.</p><p>Call it what it is. A slow grind of deaths on streets we all use. Names become numbers. The numbers don’t lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors say Fiseku, fleeing police after an attempted burglary, sped through red lights and bike lanes, ultimately hitting Servedio at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. Surveillance captured the chase. The indictment states, 'The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets.' Servedio, 36, was returning from a cycling event and had the right of way. Fiseku abandoned his truck and evaded arrest until February.
