Two Thousand Wounded. Still No Action.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 17, 2025 <em>(Revised August 24, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Precinct 115: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 17, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-loss>The Slow Grind of Loss</h3><p>In Precinct 115, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Thirteen people killed. Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over 2,300 hurt since 2022.</strong> Each number is a life changed or ended. Each crash is a story that does not make the evening news.</p><p>Just this spring, a tanker truck turned and crushed an e-bike rider on Northern Boulevard. In March, a distracted SUV driver crushed a teenager’s leg. In April, an SUV struck an elderly pedestrian in a crosswalk. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction, of streets built for speed, not safety.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A bus jumped the curb in Flushing. Eight people were hurt. One passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo; The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation goes on. The pain does not.</p><p>A child steps into the crosswalk. A truck turns left. The boy does not make it home. The record shows: <strong>failure to yield, driver inattention, crush injuries, apparent death</strong>. The police report does not mention the color of his backpack or the sound his mother made.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City leaders have tools. <strong>Speed cameras now run 24/7. The city can set lower speed limits.</strong> But the pace of change is slow. The council and DOT have started to lower limits in some zones, but the default remains too high. The police can enforce speed, failure to yield, and reckless driving. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to act.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 115 can do more.</strong> The police can crack down on speeding and failure to yield. They can focus on streets where people keep getting hurt. Local leaders can push for a 20 mph citywide limit and support the Stop Super Speeders Act. Residents can call, write, and demand action.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them: Lower the speed. Enforce the law. Protect us.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
