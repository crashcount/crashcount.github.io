An impatient SUV driver swung around traffic and ran the red light. The girls were hit. The driver fled. The girls survived, but the street will remember their names. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> they were lucky.

A Mercedes, driven by an off-duty firefighter, ran a red at 83 mph—three times the limit. The Mercedes tore through Diaz’s BMW and sent it flying. Diaz died at the scene. The firefighter had a blood alcohol level of .156. He had 25 prior school-zone speeding tickets. He posted bail and walked free. Diaz’s brother <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>called him</a> &ldquo;a dangerous person who should have never been on these streets.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, and trucks are the weapons.

Speed cameras slash speeding by more than half. But laws mean nothing if leaders do not act. Police have the power to enforce speed, failure-to-yield, and reckless driving. They can target the corners where blood stains the crosswalk. They just need to use it.</p><p>As Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>warned</a>, &ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits, more enforcement, and real protection for the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A sedan traveling west was making a left turn when it struck a 49-year-old female pedestrian crossing in a marked crosswalk without a signal. The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor by the driver. The vehicle impacted the pedestrian at the center front end, causing contusions and bruises to her hip and upper leg. The pedestrian was conscious and injured but no helmet or other safety equipment was noted. The driver was licensed and operating a 2012 Honda sedan. The report emphasizes driver error in failing to yield rather than any fault of the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
