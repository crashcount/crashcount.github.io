The report cites "Following Too Closely" as a contributing factor for at least two drivers, indicating failure to maintain safe distance in slowing or stopped traffic. The 61-year-old male driver of one sedan was injured, suffering back injuries and whiplash, and was conscious at the scene. All drivers held valid New York licenses. The impact points were center front and center back ends of the vehicles, consistent with rear-end collisions. This crash underscores the systemic danger posed by tailgating in congested urban traffic, as documented by the police report's emphasis on driver error without attributing fault to any victims.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
