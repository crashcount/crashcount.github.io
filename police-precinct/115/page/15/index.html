An impatient SUV driver swung around traffic and ran the red light. The girls were hit. The driver fled. The girls survived, but the street will remember their names. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> they were lucky.

A Mercedes, driven by an off-duty firefighter, ran a red at 83 mph—three times the limit. The Mercedes tore through Diaz’s BMW and sent it flying. Diaz died at the scene. The firefighter had a blood alcohol level of .156. He had 25 prior school-zone speeding tickets. He posted bail and walked free. Diaz’s brother <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>called him</a> &ldquo;a dangerous person who should have never been on these streets.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, and trucks are the weapons.

Speed cameras slash speeding by more than half. But laws mean nothing if leaders do not act. Police have the power to enforce speed, failure-to-yield, and reckless driving. They can target the corners where blood stains the crosswalk. They just need to use it.</p><p>As Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>warned</a>, &ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand lower speed limits, more enforcement, and real protection for the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
