The light was red. The SUV did not stop. The driver went around another car and hit them both. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. The driver fled. The street was quiet again, but the blood stayed. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the girls survived.

The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not changed. The cameras could go dark if Albany does not act. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The mayor says, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-firefighter-arraigned-man-charged-allegedly-speeding-red-light-hitting-killing-driver-another-vehicle/15961421/>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo;</a>.

They can target the corners where people keep dying.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The report states the SUV was traveling at an 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the vehicle coming fast, with the impact causing fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died before emergency responders arrived. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the driver. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing Against Signal,' but this is mentioned only after the driver’s excessive speed is cited.
