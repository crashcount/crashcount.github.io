Over two thousand injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Precinct 105 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the past twelve months alone, five people died and 738 were hurt on these streets. One was a 29-year-old man, crossing with the signal, crushed by a left-turning box truck. The cause: driver inattention and an oversized vehicle. He died at the intersection, the signal still blinking. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Last month, a 39-year-old man on a motorized scooter was killed on Nashville Boulevard. He was ejected and crushed. The crash report lists &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; Another life, gone in seconds. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=recent-crashes-unanswered-warnings>Recent Crashes, Unanswered Warnings</h2><p>The carnage does not pause. On June 8, a 26-year-old driver died at 256th Street and Hillside Avenue. On August 30, a 64-year-old man was killed at 212th Street and 90th Avenue. The pattern is the same: cars, trucks, speed, distraction, death. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have the power to act.</strong> The city has started to lower speed limits and expand speed cameras. But in this precinct, the deaths keep coming. The police can enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to know it matters.</p><p>A survivor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo;</p><p>Another witness <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>called it devastating</a>: &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The horror is routine. The response cannot be.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-step-demand-action>The Next Step: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement. Demand safer streets. Every day of silence is another day of blood on the road.</p><p><strong>Act now. Lives depend on it.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The boy was crossing the street outside of an intersection or crosswalk, described as "Crossing, No Signal, or Crosswalk." The pedestrian sustained a head injury classified as a contusion or bruise and was reported to be in shock. The report lists unspecified contributing factors but does not attribute fault to the pedestrian. The driver, a licensed female from New York, was going straight ahead at the time of impact. No explicit driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding are cited, but the collision with a pedestrian outside a crosswalk highlights systemic dangers posed by vehicle movements in uncontrolled crossing areas.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
