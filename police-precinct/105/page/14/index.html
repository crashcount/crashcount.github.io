Over two thousand injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Precinct 105 since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the past twelve months alone, five people died and 738 were hurt on these streets. One was a 29-year-old man, crossing with the signal, crushed by a left-turning box truck. The cause: driver inattention and an oversized vehicle. He died at the intersection, the signal still blinking. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Last month, a 39-year-old man on a motorized scooter was killed on Nashville Boulevard.

On June 8, a 26-year-old driver died at 256th Street and Hillside Avenue. On August 30, a 64-year-old man was killed at 212th Street and 90th Avenue.

The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have tools. They have the power to act.</strong> The city has started to lower speed limits and expand speed cameras. But in this precinct, the deaths keep coming. The police can enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They just need to know it matters.</p><p>A survivor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo;</p><p>Another witness <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>called it devastating</a>: &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The horror is routine.
