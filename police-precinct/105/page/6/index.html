Seven seriously hurt. Over 2,000 injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Precinct 105 since 2022. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars. In the last year alone, two people died and 691 were hurt. Children, elders, men, women—no one is spared. A one-year-old, a five-year-old, a 67-year-old, all struck on 73rd Avenue. One did not come home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> SUVs and sedans account for nearly every pedestrian death and most injuries. Trucks turn and crush. Speed is the silent accomplice. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people. They are families left with empty chairs.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He was hit, suffered a massive head injury, and died a week later. The driver stayed. Five months passed before charges came. The law called it failure to yield, failure to care. The penalty: a desk ticket. The family got a funeral. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>police said Wednesday</a></p><p>On Hempstead Avenue, a man was run down, then dragged for blocks. Bystanders screamed. The driver stopped, then sped off, leaving the victim to die. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>&ldquo;The conduct displayed that evening demonstrates a complete disregard for human life.&rdquo;</a> — Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can demand enforcement. They can speak up. But in Precinct 105, action is slow. Charges come late. Enforcement is thin. The police can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, and failure to yield. They can target crash hotspots. They can issue tickets. They just need to act.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Every day of silence is another family changed forever.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct. Tell them: Lower the speed. Enforce the law. Protect the people who walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
