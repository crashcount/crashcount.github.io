Two thousand injured.</strong> That is the toll in Precinct 105 since 2022. The dead do not speak. The injured carry scars. In the last year alone, two people died and 691 were hurt. Children, elders, men, women—no one is spared. A 1-year-old, a 5-year-old, a 66-year-old, and a 67-year-old were struck together on 73rd Avenue. One did not survive. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families torn apart.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this precinct, cars and SUVs killed one pedestrian and left 40 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured five. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes caused no deaths here, but the threat is constant. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is not always safe.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>The law is clear. Drivers must yield. They must not run. But the law is only as strong as those who enforce it. After a driver struck and killed a 78-year-old man at Jericho Turnpike and 91st Avenue, it took five months for charges to come. The charges were misdemeanors. The driver got a desk ticket. The victim got a grave. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>&ldquo;On Tuesday, cops charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Some deaths are more brutal. Gary Charlotin was crossing Hempstead Avenue. A driver hit him, stopped, then dragged him three blocks. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>&ldquo;The conduct displayed that evening demonstrates a complete disregard for human life.&rdquo;</a> The police can enforce the law. They can target speeders, reckless drivers, and failure-to-yield. They can make the streets safer. They just need to act.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice—by a driver, by a city, by a leader who delays. The police in Precinct 105 have the power to crack down. Local leaders can demand safer streets, lower speed limits, more enforcement. Residents can call, write, and demand action.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another funeral. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Demand action now.</strong></p></div></div><div class=mod-overlap><details id=other-geos class="other-geos mt4"><summary class="pointer fw6 mb2 f4"><span class="arrow-toggle top-arrow mr2 dn-ns">▸</span> Other Geographies</summary><p class=ml2><span class=fw6>Precinct 105 Police Precinct 105
