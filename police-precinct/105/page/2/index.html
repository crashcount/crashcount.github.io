It vaulted into oncoming traffic. Flames followed. <strong>Two young lives ended</strong>—Noah Thompson, 24, and Jewel Perez, 22. Three others were pulled from the wreck. Two more drivers, just in the wrong place, survived. Police said, &ldquo;No one in the doomed BMW was wearing a seat belt&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>NY Daily News</a>. The crash closed the highway. The city counted the bodies. The families counted the cost.</p><p>Just days before, a 39-year-old man died on Nashville Boulevard. A left turn, a distraction, a body ejected. A box truck killed a 29-year-old pedestrian on Hillside Avenue. He was crossing with the signal. The truck was making a left. The driver did not see him. He never made it across <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Eleven dead. Over 2,000 injured.</strong> Seven people seriously hurt. In the last year alone, deaths doubled. Injuries rose by a third. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home—none are spared. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Trucks killed. No bikes killed anyone here. The violence is steady, not sudden. It is a slow bleed.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. Speed limits drop on paper. Cameras blink on. But the carnage does not stop. The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket reckless drivers. They can target the places where people keep dying. They just need to act.</p><p>After the bus crash in Queens Village, a passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>described the moment</a>: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us.&rdquo; The driver did nothing wrong. The street did not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family pays. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, enforce the law, and fix the streets. Demand action from Precinct 105. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Ten years of pressure forced change. The fleet stands as the most accessible in the nation. Policy, not luck, drove this. Disabled riders gain ground. Streets shift. Access grows.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 5, 2025, that New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) reached a milestone: 50% of active taxis are now wheelchair accessible. TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift.

Prosecutors say Rosen pursued William McField, a 55-year-old motorcyclist, after a minor collision. On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."

Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists.
