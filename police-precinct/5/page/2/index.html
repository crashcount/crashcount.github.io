A cyclist, 44, struck and killed at Broome and Centre. A 69-year-old woman, crossing at Chrystie and Grand, hit by an e-bike and never got up. In the last twelve months, two people have died and five have been seriously injured on these streets. 281 more have been hurt—bodies broken, lives changed. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><p>Last week, a city worker fixing a street sign was slashed by a delivery cyclist after a near collision at Broadway and Cedar. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said</a>. The worker was left bleeding on the sidewalk. The cyclist fled.</p><p>On July 15, a food cart broke loose from a van and smashed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Police found the cache</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, they have killed at least two people and injured over 150 more. Trucks and taxis add to the toll. Bikes and e-bikes, too, have left scars and taken lives. No one is safe. Children, elders, workers—each day brings new names to the list.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>The city has lowered speed limits in some zones. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They just need to act.</p><p>Community boards and advocates have called for real solutions. &ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said a local leader</a>. &ldquo;We need to do something to make sure bicyclists feel safer.&rdquo; But too often, plans stall. Bike lanes are cut. Promises are delayed. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Every delay is another life at risk. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences. The piece underscores the disparity in enforcement and questions the effectiveness and fairness of current NYPD tactics.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

Mayor Eric Adams said, 'Fifth Avenue is a bustling boulevard... with more people walking down the street every hour than fill Madison Square Garden during a sold-out Knicks game.' The plan nearly doubles sidewalk widths and expands pedestrian zones, cutting space for vehicles. The redesign adds tree buffers, benches, and stormwater upgrades. Pedestrians make up 70% of avenue traffic but have less than half the space.

Council Member Gale Brewer criticized the move, stating, "A civil summons is a more appropriate response and thrusting people into the criminal justice system unnecessarily is bad public policy." The article notes that some officers issued summonses for actions legalized in 2019, such as cyclists proceeding with a pedestrian walk signal. Many tickets were dismissed in court due to errors by police. A class action lawsuit has been filed by a cyclist ticketed for a legal maneuver.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
