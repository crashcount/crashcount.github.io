The driver hit a man on his bike and a woman sitting on a bench. Both died where they fell. The city called it a tragedy. The District Attorney named the dead: Kevin Cruickshank, 55, and May Kwok, 63. He said, &ldquo;Kwok had been sitting on a bench and Cruickshank was riding his bike toward the Manhattan Bridge on a sidewalk at the time of the crash&rdquo; (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>).</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months, Precinct 5 saw 629 crashes. Three people died. Four suffered serious injuries. Cyclists, pedestrians, the old, the young. The numbers do not stop. In the last year, 327 people were hurt on these streets.</p><h2 id=the-citys-response-too-late-too-little>The City&rsquo;s Response: Too Late, Too Little</h2><p>After the crash, the city promised upgrades. Barriers. Narrower lanes. Lower speed limits. The Transportation Commissioner said, &ldquo;We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). But Canal Street has claimed seven lives since 2011. The fixes come after the blood dries.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-precinct-5>The Role of Precinct 5</h2><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can target the blocks where people keep dying. But the numbers show the danger is still here. Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses, motorcycles, bikes—none are blameless. But the deadliest threat is speed and steel.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice, a policy, a failure to act. Call your council member. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another name on a bench, another bike left twisted in the gutter.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
