A cyclist, 44, struck and killed at Broome and Centre. A 69-year-old woman, crossing at Chrystie and Grand, hit by an e-bike and never got up. In the last twelve months, two people have died and five have been seriously injured on these streets. 281 more have been hurt—bodies broken, lives changed. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><p>Last week, a city worker fixing a street sign was slashed by a delivery cyclist after a near collision at Broadway and Cedar. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said</a>. The worker was left bleeding on the sidewalk. The cyclist fled.</p><p>On July 15, a food cart broke loose from a van and smashed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Police found the cache</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, they have killed at least two people and injured over 150 more. Trucks and taxis add to the toll. Bikes and e-bikes, too, have left scars and taken lives. No one is safe. Children, elders, workers—each day brings new names to the list.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>The city has lowered speed limits in some zones. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The police have the power to enforce the law. They can crack down on speeding, reckless driving, failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They just need to act.</p><p>Community boards and advocates have called for real solutions. &ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said a local leader</a>. &ldquo;We need to do something to make sure bicyclists feel safer.&rdquo; But too often, plans stall. Bike lanes are cut. Promises are delayed. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Every delay is another life at risk. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
