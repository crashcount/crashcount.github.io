A 21-year-old, driving a Nissan Rogue, hit him and kept going. The cyclist was left with severe head trauma, unconscious as paramedics worked to save him. The driver was arrested two hours later, charged with leaving the scene and driving without a license. The bike’s red light kept flashing in the road. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, Precinct 5 saw <strong>3 deaths and 324 injuries</strong> from crashes. Four people suffered injuries so severe they may never recover. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p>The violence is relentless. Last fall, a 54-year-old woman was killed crossing Spring and Crosby. The driver failed to yield. On Canal, a 55-year-old man died under the wheels of an SUV. A 69-year-old woman was killed by an e-bike at Grand and Chrystie. The stories change, but the ending is the same.</p><p>Most of the harm comes from cars and trucks—<strong>3 deaths, 2 serious injuries, 194 other injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds add more. Bikes, too, have killed and injured. No one is safe when the street is a battlefield.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has called out city neglect after deadly crashes. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>Council Member Christopher Marte cites Department of Transportation for ongoing neglect.</a> The police have the power to enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots.
