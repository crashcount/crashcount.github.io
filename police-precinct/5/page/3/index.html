They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But too often, the focus shifts. In May, the NYPD began issuing criminal summonses to cyclists for low-level violations. Now, a rider must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. &ldquo;Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>Advocates call this &ldquo;a dangerous escalation&rdquo;—punishing the vulnerable while drivers keep killing. The city touts new bike lanes and lower speed limits. But the deaths keep coming. The silence from local leaders is louder than sirens.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 5 can do more.</strong> The police can crack down on reckless driving, not just ticket bikes. Local leaders can push for real change—protected intersections, slower speeds, more enforcement where it matters. Residents can demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the precinct.

Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes.
