The driver hit a man on his bike and a woman sitting on a bench. Both died where they fell. The city called it a tragedy. The District Attorney named the dead: Kevin Cruickshank, 55, and May Kwok, 63. He said, &ldquo;Kwok had been sitting on a bench and Cruickshank was riding his bike toward the Manhattan Bridge on a sidewalk at the time of the crash&rdquo; (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>).</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months, Precinct 5 saw 629 crashes. Three people died. Four suffered serious injuries. Cyclists, pedestrians, the old, the young. The numbers do not stop. In the last year, 327 people were hurt on these streets.</p><h2 id=the-citys-response-too-late-too-little>The City&rsquo;s Response: Too Late, Too Little</h2><p>After the crash, the city promised upgrades. Barriers. Narrower lanes. Lower speed limits. The Transportation Commissioner said, &ldquo;We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). But Canal Street has claimed seven lives since 2011. The fixes come after the blood dries.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-precinct-5>The Role of Precinct 5</h2><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on failure to yield. They can target the blocks where people keep dying. But the numbers show the danger is still here. Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses, motorcycles, bikes—none are blameless. But the deadliest threat is speed and steel.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice, a policy, a failure to act. Call your council member. Demand enforcement. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another name on a bench, another bike left twisted in the gutter.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Commissioner Tisch told the Council, "Pass e-bike regulations." Cyclists object to criminal charges for minor violations, arguing for civil penalties instead. The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool.

The city’s pulse slows, but the outcome is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 23, 2025, that New York’s congestion pricing tolls remain in place despite three missed federal deadlines to remove them. The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Tourists and workers crowd the street. Mayor Adams pledges $400 million. Some push back. The avenue stays dangerous for those on foot. Space for people, not just cars, hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on May 22, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams will allocate over $400 million to a pedestrian-focused redesign of Fifth Avenue, stretching from Bryant Park to Central Park. The plan aims to double sidewalk widths, making room for the heavy foot traffic from both tourists and local workers. The article quotes a local worker: 'When you're walking around and getting from one place to another, yeah, it does get kind of annoying.' The proposal faces backlash, highlighting the tension between pedestrian needs and existing street design. No specific driver errors are cited, but the move underscores the city's ongoing struggle to prioritize vulnerable road users over vehicle flow.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.'

The city’s policy stands, unmoved by the law.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (May 13, 2025), cyclist Oliver Casey Esparza filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD, alleging officers wrongfully ticket cyclists for running red lights even when they follow pedestrian crossing signals, as permitted by a 2019 City Council law. The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025. The NYPD declined to comment. The case highlights a gap between city law and police enforcement, raising questions about policy compliance and systemic accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fuselage, rotor, and tail tore loose. Loud bangs echoed. The craft plunged. No black box. No warning. Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
