A woman crossing the street. A child on the way to school. In Precinct 5, the story repeats. <strong>Four people killed. Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> Eight hundred thirty-two hurt since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>A cyclist, age 44, was thrown into the street at Broome and Centre. He died under the wheels of a truck. The news called it out: &ldquo;A cyclist was struck and killed after he rode into a van&rsquo;s open door, propelling him into the intersection&mldr; where he was subsequently crushed under a moving commercial truck&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-bike-pedestrian-traffic-collisions/>amNY</a>).</p><p>A 55-year-old man, walking on Canal, was hit by an SUV. He died. A 69-year-old woman, crossing at Grand and Chrystie, was killed by a bike. A 21-year-old, struck by a taxi and sedan at Houston and 1st, never made it home.</p><p><strong>No one is safe. Not the young, not the old. Not the ones on foot, not the ones on wheels.</strong></p><h3 id=the-police-and-the-politics>The Police and the Politics</h3><p>The NYPD holds the power to enforce. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. But too often, the focus shifts. In May, the NYPD began issuing criminal summonses to cyclists for low-level violations. Now, a rider must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. &ldquo;Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>Advocates call this &ldquo;a dangerous escalation&rdquo;—punishing the vulnerable while drivers keep killing. The city touts new bike lanes and lower speed limits. But the deaths keep coming. The silence from local leaders is louder than sirens.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 5 can do more.</strong> The police can crack down on reckless driving, not just ticket bikes. Local leaders can push for real change—protected intersections, slower speeds, more enforcement where it matters. Residents can demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the precinct. Tell them: Enough.</strong></p><p>Every day they wait, another family waits for someone who will not come home.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
