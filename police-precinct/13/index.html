Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, workers, children. In the last year alone, 326 people were injured on these streets. Eleven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. No one was spared—not the young, not the old, not the ones just crossing with the light.</p><p>A 77-year-old woman was killed crossing Lexington Avenue with the signal. The driver turned left and never saw her. She died on the street. The driver was unlicensed. The record shows only this: &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; and &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-unanswered-cries>Recent Crashes, Unanswered Cries</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. In April, a taxi turned left and struck four people on Fifth Avenue. In May, a cyclist was thrown in a collision on East 23rd. The list goes on. Each crash is a wound that never heals. Each one could have been stopped.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can focus on the corners where people keep getting hit. But the silence is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken.

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.

The street waits for change.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on June 15, 2025, that the NYC Department of Transportation’s plan to convert 34th Street into a busway drew mixed reactions at a Community Board 6 meeting. The board voted 31-5 in favor. Supporters called current bus speeds 'painfully slow' and urged the city to 'prioritize pedestrians and transit users.' Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.' The DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent. The proposal would force cars to exit 34th Street quickly or face tickets, echoing rules on 14th Street. The debate highlights the tension between transit improvements and neighborhood traffic concerns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life."

A cyclist struck it. Metal hit flesh. The rider flew, hit the pavement, scraped his arm. Driver inattention cut through the afternoon. The street stayed loud. The cyclist stayed conscious. The system failed again.</p><p class=mb3>A crash unfolded on East 28th Street in Manhattan. A taxi, parked at the curb, opened its door into the path of a cyclist riding east. The cyclist, a 44-year-old man, struck the door and was ejected from his bike, suffering abrasions to his arm. According to the police report, 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' was listed as the primary contributing factor. The taxi driver and two other occupants were involved but not reported injured. The crash data shows the cyclist was not using safety equipment, but this is noted only after the driver's error. The impact highlights the danger of inattentive driving and the vulnerability of those on bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
