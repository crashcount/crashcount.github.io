Twenty-six left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives lost, eight more bodies broken. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h2 id=the-latest-wounds>The Latest Wounds</h2><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver did not stop. He drove onto the sidewalk, then took the SUV to a car wash. He told police he ran because he had no license. The cyclist was left with a shattered skull. &ldquo;He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>Days before, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue.

Buses and trucks took another life. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens more. The street does not care what hit you. It only matters that you were there.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-power>Leadership: Promises and Power</h2><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. The council can demand enforcement. The police can target speeders, reckless drivers, and failure-to-yield at known hotspots. But the blood keeps coming. The law is there. The tools are there. The will is not always there.</p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Tell them to enforce speed limits, crack down on reckless driving, and fix the streets where people keep getting hurt.

A driver jumped a curb, killing May Kwon and cyclist Kevin Cruickshank. Another driver hit a food truck, injuring two. Advocates and officials blame the city for failing to act, quoting Ben Furnas: "City Hall knows that Canal Street is one of the most dangerous in our city, but they've stalled any improvements." Despite years of studies, no major safety upgrades have been made. The article highlights a lack of protected bike paths and safe pedestrian space, exposing systemic neglect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
