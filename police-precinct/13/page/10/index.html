According to the police report, a Lexus sedan made a left turn while an e-bike rider, 23, continued straight. The sedan struck the cyclist, ejecting him from the bike. He suffered severe bleeding and injuries to his entire body. He died at the scene. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The data shows the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the primary driver error. The crash highlights the lethal consequences when drivers ignore traffic controls and vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
