A cyclist rode north. Steel met skull. He flew, struck pavement. Blood pooled on the street.' The 26-year-old male cyclist was ejected from his bike, sustained a head injury, and was conscious but bleeding severely from the head. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail appears only after the driver error is cited. The impact point was the taxi’s left front bumper and the bike’s right front. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
