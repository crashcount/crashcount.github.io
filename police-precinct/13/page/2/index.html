A motorcyclist died on the FDR Drive. In June, a pedestrian died at E 28th Street and 3rd Avenue. The corners keep changing. The ending does not.</p><p>In the last 12 months: 3 deaths, 14 serious injuries, 745 crashes (NYC Open Data). Year‑to‑date, crashes are up about 36% over last year, with 3 people dead. This is one precinct. One set of streets.</p><h3 id=where-it-happens>Where it happens</h3><p>Hotspots show up again and again. FDR Drive and 3rd Avenue lead the list. The data also points to late‑day and evening harm — nights are no refuge. Contributing factors include other causes, driver inattention/distraction, failure to yield and disregarded traffic control. Cars and SUVs cause most of the harm here.</p><p>Work the corners that keep breaking people. Concrete fixes that work now: protected bike lanes and daylighting on 3rd Avenue; leading pedestrian intervals at east‑west crossings; hardened curb turns and narrowed lanes at high‑risk corners; and sustained night enforcement on FDR Drive and the avenues.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders talk. Streets wait.</h3><p>After two people died downtown, the city promised immediate changes: &ldquo;As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long‑term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor&rdquo; (Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Gothamist, 2025-08-07). Advocates warned the corridor will still have many deadly blocks.</p><p>Fourteen Street has a redesign set to begin next year. The city says the plan will &ldquo;improve the pedestrian experience&rdquo; (NY1, 2025-08-15). Don’t let those lessons stop at one corridor. Make them precinct‑wide.</p><h3 id=what-police-can-do-tonight>What police can do tonight</h3><p>Flood the hotspots. Enforce speed. Cite failure‑to‑yield and red‑light runs. Run repeat night operations where injuries cluster.

Lowering New York City’s default speed limit would slow every street. Require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders to prevent repeat offenders from killing again. Those two moves — slower streets and speed limiters for repeat violators — must be part of any precinct plan.</p><p>Call the precinct. Call your council member. Call DOT.
