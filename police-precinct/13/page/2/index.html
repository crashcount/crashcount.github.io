Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the cost of walking, biking, or crossing the street in Midtown, Gramercy, and Murray Hill.</p><p>The dead do not speak. But the record does. A 77-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Lexington and East 29th, struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. The driver was unlicensed. She died on the street, her blood on the crosswalk. The crash report lists the cause: &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>).</p><p>A cyclist, 23, killed at Park Avenue South and East 27th. The car turned left. The bike went straight. The crash report says, again, &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>).</p><p><strong>The pattern is simple. The pain is not.</strong></p><h3 id=the-police-power-and-responsibility>The Police: Power and Responsibility</h3><p>The police in Precinct 13 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They can act before the next name is added to the list.</p><p>But action is not a press release. It is a summons in a driver&rsquo;s hand. It is a patrol car parked at the intersection where the last person died. It is a message, clear as a siren: slow down, or pay.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>City leaders have made moves. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the work is not done. The deaths keep coming. The injuries pile up. <strong>&ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">DOT press release</a>).</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law,&rdquo;</strong> said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch (<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,a%20vision%20%E2%80%94it%27s%20a%20reality">NYPD enforcement statement</a>).</p><p>But words are not enough. The numbers do not change on their own.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-action>The Next Step: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Tell them the blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Demand enforcement. Demand lower speeds. Demand safe crossings. <strong>Do not wait for another name.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Federal officials had threatened to withhold funds for road and street safety projects if the city continued the program.

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter.

The coalition pushes for the SAFE Streets Package, including speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders and the 'Idaho stop' for cyclists. The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.' The piece highlights the urgent need for policy change to address reckless driving and systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
