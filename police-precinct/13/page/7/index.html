Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the cost of walking, biking, or crossing the street in Midtown, Gramercy, and Murray Hill.</p><p>The dead do not speak. But the record does. A 77-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Lexington and East 29th, struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. The driver was unlicensed. She died on the street, her blood on the crosswalk. The crash report lists the cause: &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>).</p><p>A cyclist, 23, killed at Park Avenue South and East 27th. The car turned left. The bike went straight. The crash report says, again, &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>).</p><p><strong>The pattern is simple. The pain is not.</strong></p><h3 id=the-police-power-and-responsibility>The Police: Power and Responsibility</h3><p>The police in Precinct 13 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They can act before the next name is added to the list.</p><p>But action is not a press release. It is a summons in a driver&rsquo;s hand. It is a patrol car parked at the intersection where the last person died. It is a message, clear as a siren: slow down, or pay.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>City leaders have made moves. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the work is not done. The deaths keep coming. The injuries pile up. <strong>&ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">DOT press release</a>).</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law,&rdquo;</strong> said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch (<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,a%20vision%20%E2%80%94it%27s%20a%20reality">NYPD enforcement statement</a>).</p><p>But words are not enough. The numbers do not change on their own.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-action>The Next Step: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Call the precinct.</strong> Tell them the blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Demand enforcement. Demand lower speeds. Demand safe crossings. <strong>Do not wait for another name.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
