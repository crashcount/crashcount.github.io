The impact from the taxi’s right front bumper caused severe lacerations to her pelvis. The report states she remained conscious and bleeding at the scene. The narrative notes, 'The cab kept straight. The road kept moving. No one stopped.' Driver inattention or distraction is listed as a contributing factor, highlighting systemic danger for pedestrians on high-speed corridors. The police report also cites 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but only after noting the driver’s inattention. The woman was not at an intersection, according to the report.
