The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-precincts-role-tools-unused>The Precinct’s Role: Tools Unused</h3><p><strong>The police have the power.</strong> They can ticket speeders. They can crack down on drivers who run red lights or fail to yield. They can target corners where the blood dries slow. But too often, the work falls to the families left behind.</p><p>After a hit-and-run at 5th and 13th, the victim, Myung Jin Chung, woke up in an ambulance. &ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-arrested-hit-run-52-year-old-bicyclist-west-village-last-month/16705843/>he said</a>. The driver had blown through a red light and fled. The arrest came only after public outcry and video evidence. The system reacts, but it does not prevent.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new speed cameras, lower limits, and intersection redesigns. But the pace is slow. Cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. The city can lower speed limits now, but has not. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The streets wait.</p><p>The family of Abdulhekim Esiyok, killed by a drunk driver on Third Avenue, is left with nothing but grief. &ldquo;The family is devastated. They&rsquo;re still in disbelief,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/us-news/family-of-turkish-immigrant-killed-in-dwi-crash-sues-nyc-bars/>said their lawyer</a>.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph limits. Demand speed cameras that never sleep. Demand the police use every tool they have. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
