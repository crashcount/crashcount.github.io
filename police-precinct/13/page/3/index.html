Twenty-two left with life-changing wounds.</strong> That’s the count in Precinct 13 since 2022. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 77-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was killed by a left-turning SUV. The driver failed to yield. She never made it to the other side, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars, SUVs, and trucks caused most deaths and injuries. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the steel does the killing. The street does not forgive. The city counts the bodies. The families count the empty chairs.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. In the last year alone, <strong>327 people were hurt in 581 crashes</strong>. Eleven suffered serious injuries. No one was spared by age: children, the old, the young. The pattern repeats. A cyclist killed on East 21st. A pedestrian crushed on Broadway. A woman dead at Lexington and 29th. The details are always the same. Metal meets flesh. Flesh loses.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Speed cameras. Lower speed limits. New laws. But the pace is slow. The police can crack down on speeders, reckless drivers, and failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the curb. They can write tickets. They can show up. But too often, they don’t.</p><p>The message from officials is clear. &ldquo;Our message to drivers was clear: follow the rules or face the law,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,a%20vision%20%E2%80%94it%27s%20a%20reality">said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch</a>. But the rules are only as strong as the will to enforce them. The city says, &ldquo;One traffic fatality is one too many,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/914-23/mayor-adams-launches-new-effort-make-thousands-nyc-intersections-safer-of-broad-new#:~:text=%E2%80%9COne%20traffic%20fatality%20is%20one,%E2%80%9D">said Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi</a>. Yet the deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell Precinct 13 to enforce the law. Tell them to protect the crosswalk, not just the car. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Don’t wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries.
