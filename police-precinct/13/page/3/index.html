Since 2022, <strong>seven people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>Twenty-six suffered serious injuries</strong>. These are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, leaving the man with head trauma. Police found the driver later. He told them he ran because he had no license. He now faces charges for leaving the scene and driving without a license. The cyclist was taken to Bellevue, alive but in critical condition. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>He told police he fled initially because he did not have a license.</a></p><p>On June 16, a bus crushed a pedestrian at 3rd Avenue and 28th Street. The man died at the intersection. The cause: driver inattention. No warning. No time to move. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo; was listed as the cause.</a></p><h3 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 401 people have been hurt in 728 crashes here.</strong> Two did not survive. Fourteen were left with injuries that will not heal. The victims are not just numbers. They are young and old. Eighteen children were hurt. Eleven people over 65. The violence is steady. It does not care who you are.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed three. Buses killed one. Taxis, bikes, mopeds, trucks—all play their part. But the pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city has tools. The precinct can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and watch the hotspots. But the blood keeps flowing. The law is there. The will is not. Residents see it. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; a woman named Nita said.</a></p><p>Local leaders have passed laws. They talk about Vision Zero. But the deaths do not stop. The injuries do not stop. The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can act. Or it can wait for the next siren.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Precinct 13 does not need more talk. It needs action.</strong> Residents must demand it. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Tell them to enforce the law, slow the cars, and protect the people who walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool.

Advocates gather in Albany. They press lawmakers for action. Speeders roam. Streets stay deadly. The call is clear: fix the system, stop the pain.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-05-14) reports on Families for Safe Streets and other advocates lobbying in Albany after a 13-year-old girl was killed by an SUV. The coalition pushes for the SAFE Streets Package, including speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders and the 'Idaho stop' for cyclists. The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.' The piece highlights the urgent need for policy change to address reckless driving and systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Law says cyclists can cross with pedestrians. NYPD ignores it. Tickets pile up. One rider fights back in court. The city’s policy stands, unmoved by the law.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (May 13, 2025), cyclist Oliver Casey Esparza filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD, alleging officers wrongfully ticket cyclists for running red lights even when they follow pedestrian crossing signals, as permitted by a 2019 City Council law. The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025. The NYPD declined to comment. The case highlights a gap between city law and police enforcement, raising questions about policy compliance and systemic accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
