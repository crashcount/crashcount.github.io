Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, workers, children. In the last year alone, 326 people were injured on these streets. Eleven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. No one was spared—not the young, not the old, not the ones just crossing with the light.</p><p>A 77-year-old woman was killed crossing Lexington Avenue with the signal. The driver turned left and never saw her. She died on the street. The driver was unlicensed. The record shows only this: &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; and &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-unanswered-cries>Recent Crashes, Unanswered Cries</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. In April, a taxi turned left and struck four people on Fifth Avenue. In May, a cyclist was thrown in a collision on East 23rd. The list goes on. Each crash is a wound that never heals. Each one could have been stopped.</p><p>The police have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can focus on the corners where people keep getting hit. But the silence is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have spoken.

The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.
