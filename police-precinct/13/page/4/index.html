Twenty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. Each number is a body broken, a life changed, a family left with questions and rage. The dead do not speak, but the record is clear.</p><p>Just last month, a 49-year-old man was crushed by a bus at the corner of East 28th and 3rd Avenue. He died in the street, the cause listed as &ldquo;driver inattention&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). In December, a 23-year-old cyclist was killed by a turning sedan on Park Avenue South. The charge: &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way.&rdquo; The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—responsible for most deaths and injuries. Buses and trucks add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the scale is not the same. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe. &ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said Community Board 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia</a>, as city leaders cut protected bike lanes from the Fifth Avenue redesign. The board warned: <strong>without safe space, cyclists will ride the sidewalk, and conflict will follow.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Speed cameras run 24/7. New laws allow lower speed limits.</strong> But the pace is slow. The city sprinkles 20 mph zones, but the default remains higher. The police can enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target hotspots. They can act. They must act. &ldquo;We need to do something to make sure bicyclists feel safer,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said Lavingia</a>. But the city delays, and the bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand enforcement at every deadly corner. Demand real protection for those who walk and ride. <strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
