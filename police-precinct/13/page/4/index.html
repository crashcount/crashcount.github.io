Twenty-three left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In just over three years, Precinct 13 has seen 2,125 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper. A bus crushed a man at 3rd Avenue and East 28th. A cyclist, age 23, bled out on East 21st. A woman, 48, was killed by an SUV on Broadway. These are not numbers. They are lives, ended or broken, in the space between the curb and the crosswalk.</p><h2 id=the-latest-wounds>The Latest Wounds</h2><p>Last week, a city worker was fixing a street sign at Broadway and Cedar. An e-bike rider nearly hit him. The rider pulled a box cutter and slashed the worker’s arm and back. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a> and promised to work with police to find the attacker. The worker survived. The fear lingers.</p><p>Just days before, a van crashed in Midtown. Police found <strong>76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline</strong> inside. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The Manhattan DA is handling the case. The fire risk was real. The outcome, this time, was luck, not policy. The <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-arrested-nypd-discovers-75-gallons-gasoline-10-diesel-inside-van-manhattan-nyc/17154624/>driver was arrested</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h2><p><strong>Most of the dead and wounded are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs caused the most harm, but bikes and mopeds are not blameless. The police have the power to enforce speed limits, ticket reckless drivers, and target crash hotspots. They have the tools. They need the will.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have the power to change the odds. The city can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and crack down on repeat offenders. But action is slow. The DOT says, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;Our thoughts are with our employee and their loved ones, and we hope they make a quick recovery. We will be coordinating with NYPD to bring the perpetrator to justice.&rdquo;</a> Words are not enough. Enforcement and redesign save lives. Delay kills.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement, safer crossings, and real protection for people outside the car.</strong> Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
