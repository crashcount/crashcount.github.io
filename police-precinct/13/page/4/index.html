Struck by an SUV. She died on the street. The driver failed to yield. The SUV was unlicensed. The city moved on. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>In three and a half years, <strong>Precinct 13 saw 5 deaths and 22 serious injuries</strong>. <strong>Over 1,000 people hurt.</strong> Most were walking or riding. Some were children. Some were old. The pain is not spread evenly. The most vulnerable bleed the most.</p><h3 id=enforcement-who-pays-the-price>Enforcement: Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The NYPD has the power to act. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. But the crackdown has landed hardest on those with the least. Cyclists and delivery workers now face criminal summonses for minor violations. One protester <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/it-seems-unfair-e-bike-riders-protest-nypd-crackdown-and-criminal-summonses>put it plain</a>: “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.”</p><p>The police <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/cyclists-protest-nypd-criminalization-push-against-bikers-for-traffic-infractions-AD4665020>say</a>, “When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.” But the numbers tell a different story. Cars and SUVs kill. Bikes get tickets. The crackdown does not touch the root.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-or-delay>Leadership: Progress or Delay?</h3><p><strong>City leaders have the tools.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not. Speed cameras cut speeding and injuries, but the law to keep them alive is stalled. The mayor says, “One life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action-now>What Next: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Precinct 13 does not need more studies.
