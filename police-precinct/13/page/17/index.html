Since 2022, five people have died in crashes. Over 1,100 have been hurt. Twenty-two suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. A 77-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Lexington and 29th, was killed by a left-turning SUV. The driver was unlicensed. She never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=recent-crashes-unanswered-wounds>Recent Crashes, Unanswered Wounds</h3><p>The pain does not fade. In the last year alone, 325 people were injured in 579 crashes. Eleven were left with serious wounds. Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—over 200 crashes, seven serious injuries, two deaths. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the numbers are clear: the larger the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><p>The news keeps coming. Just last week, three NJ Transit buses collided at Port Authority, sending a dozen to the hospital. &ldquo;One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/port-authority-bus-terminal-accident-nyc/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. The ramp was blocked for hours. The city moved on. The injured did not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras. Lower limits. More enforcement. But the pace is slow. The police can crack down on speeding, reckless turns, failure to yield. They can target the corners where blood stains the crosswalk. They can write tickets that matter. They just need to act.</p><p>The message from City Hall is clear: &ldquo;The 32 percent drop in traffic fatalities that we have seen this year is historic… further proof that our Vision Zero efforts are working,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/vision-zero.shtml#:~:text=,on%20and%20off%20our%20streets">said Mayor Adams</a>. But for the families left behind, the drop is not enough. One death is too many. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand action.</strong> Tell them the numbers. Tell them the names. Tell them you want speed limits enforced, reckless drivers off the street, and every crash treated as a preventable tragedy. The slow grind of traffic violence will not stop until we force it to stop.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
