Six people are dead. Twenty-three have suffered serious injuries. Over 1,100 have been hurt since 2022. The toll is steady, merciless, and it does not care who you are. A child struck at East 14th. A cyclist thrown from his bike on 23rd. A pedestrian crushed by a bus at 28th and 3rd. The stories change, but the outcome is the same: bodies broken, families left with silence.</p><p>Just last month, a bus rolled through the intersection at 3rd Avenue and East 28th Street. A 49-year-old man was killed. The record shows only this: &ldquo;Crush Injuries&rdquo; and &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to city crash data</a>. No more words are needed.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs are the main threat. They have killed three, injured 217, and left seven with serious wounds. Trucks and buses have claimed another life and hurt 19 more. Bikes are not blameless—42 injuries, three serious—but the scale is not the same. The street is a battlefield, and the deadliest weapons are still behind the wheel.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city has begun to act. Speed cameras now run 24/7. The law allows for lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. The carnage continues. Police have the tools. They can ticket speeders, crack down on failure to yield, and target the corners where blood is most often spilled. They just need to use them.</p><p>When a crash shut down the Lincoln Tunnel, the city watched the chaos. &ldquo;Over an hour delay stuck in the Lincoln tunnel while a car was on fire,&rdquo; a commuter <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>wrote</a>. When two buses collided at Port Authority, &ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. The system is brittle. The cost is paid in flesh.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action-now>What Next: Demand Action Now</h3><p>Precinct 13 does not need more studies. It needs enforcement. Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement, failure-to-yield crackdowns, and real protection for people outside the car. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.
