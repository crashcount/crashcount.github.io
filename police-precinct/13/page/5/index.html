Twenty-two seriously injured.</strong> In just over three years, this is the price Precinct 13 has paid for daily violence on its streets. These numbers are not just statistics—they are people. A 77-year-old woman, crossing with the light on Lexington Avenue, was struck and killed by a turning SUV. The driver was unlicensed. She died at the intersection, head bleeding, signal in her favor. No second chances. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Cyclists and pedestrians take the brunt. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—<strong>four deaths, seven serious injuries</strong>. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The street does not forgive. The city counts the bodies.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not slow. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>325 people injured, eleven seriously</strong>. No deaths this year, but luck will not hold. The wounds are deep: broken legs, crushed hips, lives changed in a blink. The latest numbers show the same pattern—drivers failing to yield, turning left, not seeing, not stopping. The old story, told again and again.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city has tools: speed cameras, lower limits, new laws. But change is slow. Police can act. They can ticket speeders, crack down on failure to yield, target the corners where blood stains the curb. They know where the danger is. They just need to move.</p><p>The message from the top is clear.

Still, the pace is glacial.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-turn-up-the-heat>What You Can Do: Turn Up the Heat</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand enforcement. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand action at every deadly corner. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.
