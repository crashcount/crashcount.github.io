A motorcyclist died on the FDR Drive. In June, a pedestrian died at E 28th Street and 3rd Avenue. The corners keep changing. The ending does not.</p><p>In the last 12 months: 3 deaths, 14 serious injuries, 745 crashes (NYC Open Data). Year‑to‑date, crashes are up about 36% over last year, with 3 people dead. This is one precinct. One set of streets.</p><h3 id=where-it-happens>Where it happens</h3><p>Hotspots show up again and again. FDR Drive and 3rd Avenue lead the list. The data also points to late‑day and evening harm — nights are no refuge. Contributing factors include other causes, driver inattention/distraction, failure to yield and disregarded traffic control. Cars and SUVs cause most of the harm here.</p><p>Work the corners that keep breaking people. Concrete fixes that work now: protected bike lanes and daylighting on 3rd Avenue; leading pedestrian intervals at east‑west crossings; hardened curb turns and narrowed lanes at high‑risk corners; and sustained night enforcement on FDR Drive and the avenues.</p><h3 id=leaders-talk-streets-wait>Leaders talk. Streets wait.</h3><p>After two people died downtown, the city promised immediate changes: &ldquo;As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long‑term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor&rdquo; (Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Gothamist, 2025-08-07). Advocates warned the corridor will still have many deadly blocks.</p><p>Fourteen Street has a redesign set to begin next year. The city says the plan will &ldquo;improve the pedestrian experience&rdquo; (NY1, 2025-08-15). Don’t let those lessons stop at one corridor. Make them precinct‑wide.</p><h3 id=what-police-can-do-tonight>What police can do tonight</h3><p>Flood the hotspots. Enforce speed. Cite failure‑to‑yield and red‑light runs. Run repeat night operations where injuries cluster. Return to the same corners until the pattern breaks.</p><h3 id=what-to-push-without-delay>What to push, without delay</h3><ul><li>Fund protected lanes and daylighting on 3rd Avenue and the cross streets.</li><li>Install LPIs and hardened turns at key intersections.</li><li>Launch targeted night enforcement on FDR Drive and the avenues and run repeated failure‑to‑yield stings.</li></ul><h3 id=political-solutions-that-scale>Political solutions that scale</h3><p>Local patterns demand citywide fixes. Lowering New York City’s default speed limit would slow every street. Require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders to prevent repeat offenders from killing again. Those two moves — slower streets and speed limiters for repeat violators — must be part of any precinct plan.</p><p>Call the precinct. Call your council member. Call DOT. Demand the crackdowns and the concrete now. The next siren is already warming up.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A northbound cyclist struck him head-on and did not stop. Blood pooled on the asphalt. The rider vanished. The city’s traffic violence left another body broken, another story unfinished.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 39-year-old man was struck by a northbound cyclist near 287 Park Avenue South, close to 28th Street in Manhattan. The cyclist hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe head trauma; the victim lay semiconscious on the asphalt with a cracked skull. The cyclist did not remain at the scene and continued riding north. The report notes the pedestrian stepped into the street without a signal, but does not list any driver errors or contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.' The critical driver error highlighted is the cyclist's failure to stop after the crash, as detailed: 'The rider did not stop. The bike rode on.' This incident underscores the persistent dangers faced by pedestrians on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
