Twenty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak, but the wounds remain. A 49-year-old man crushed by a bus at 3rd Avenue and East 28th. A 23-year-old cyclist, body broken, left bleeding on Park Avenue South. A woman, 48, struck and killed by an SUV while walking on Broadway. These are not accidents. They are the price of inaction.</p><h3 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage continues. Just last month, a convertible struck a child at East 14th. A taxi turned left and threw a woman to the pavement on 1st Avenue. Four pedestrians were hit at once on Fifth Avenue. The stories pile up. Each one is a life changed or ended. Each one is a warning ignored.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>The city has tools: speed cameras, lower limits, new laws.

They can act. They must act. Every delay is another body on the street.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Residents and advocates must demand more. Call your council member. Demand the precinct crack down on speeding and failure to yield. Insist on protected lanes, not empty promises. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
