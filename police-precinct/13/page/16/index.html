Twenty-two suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead include the old and the young. A 77-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was killed by an SUV making a left turn. The driver was unlicensed. She never made it across <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Lexington Avenue</a>.</p><p>A cyclist, age 23, was killed at Park Avenue South and East 27th.
