Twenty-six left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, two more lives lost, eight more bodies broken. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h2 id=the-latest-wounds>The Latest Wounds</h2><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver did not stop. He drove onto the sidewalk, then took the SUV to a car wash. He told police he ran because he had no license. The cyclist was left with a shattered skull. &ldquo;He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>Days before, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue.

It only matters that you were there.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-power>Leadership: Promises and Power</h2><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. The council can demand enforcement. The police can target speeders, reckless drivers, and failure-to-yield at known hotspots. But the blood keeps coming. The law is there. The tools are there. The will is not always there.</p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the precinct.
