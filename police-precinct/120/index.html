Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong></p><p>Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street when an e-scooter struck him. The impact threw the rider. Gomez-Guallazaca died at Richmond University Medical Center. Police are still investigating. There have been no arrests. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>&ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A 68-year-old man was killed in a crosswalk at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place. The SUV driver failed to yield and turned left. The man died from head injuries. Another woman, 82, died at Bard Avenue and Forest Avenue. She was hit by an SUV. The driver was distracted. She never made it across.</p><h3 id=the-police-and-the-power-to-act>The Police and the Power to Act</h3><p>The police in Precinct 120 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. But the danger remains. <strong>Ten people have died here since 2022.</strong></p><p>Even the police are not spared. In March, two officers crashed their cruiser into a building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-crash-2-officers-recovering-crashing-police-cruiser-staten-island/16028315/>&ldquo;Another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>City leaders say they want zero deaths. They passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the city has not yet acted. The law sits idle. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.' The crackdown targets vehicles often used by delivery workers but also linked by officials to traffic violations and other offenses.

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
