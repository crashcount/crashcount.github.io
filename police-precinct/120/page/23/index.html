He died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4657218</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>12 people killed</strong> on streets in Precinct 120 since Jan 1, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Year to date, reported crashes are up 28.4% and deaths rose from 1 to <strong>4</strong> compared to last year to date (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-gives-way>Where the street gives way</h3><p>Forest Avenue keeps taking lives. A 68-year-old man crossing in a marked crosswalk at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place was killed by a left-turning SUV just after 6 AM on Jan 6, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4784160</a>). An 82-year-old woman was killed at Forest and Bard in Oct 2023 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4673459</a>). Bay Street is a hotspot too; the cyclist killed at Bay and Chestnut is one of the corridor’s worst outcomes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4657218</a>). Victory Boulevard, Clove Road, and Targee Street also rack up injuries and deaths in this precinct (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>When are people getting hurt? Injuries peak in the late afternoon; 5 PM is the worst hour for injuries in this precinct. Deaths show up at noon and again after dark, including 7 PM to 10 PM (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=patterns-we-can-touch>Patterns we can touch</h3><p>Named factors recur: failure to yield, driver inattention, and unsafe speed show up in fatal files here, including the Forest Avenue crosswalk death (failure to yield, distraction) and the Verrazzano motorcycle death (unsafe speed) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashIDs 4784160, 4837825</a>). Pedestrians are hit most often by sedans and SUVs; among pedestrian cases recorded here, SUVs, trucks, and buses are in the mix, and they kill (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Micromobility adds danger when streets are built for speed. On May 17, 2025, an e-scooter struck a 58-year-old man crossing Targee Street. He died at the hospital; the 25-year-old rider was also injured (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>). Weeks later, a motorcyclist died on Bay Street after hitting the door of a car making a K-turn (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>amNY</a>). And just after 1 AM on Aug 5, a 13-year-old on a moped hit an MTA bus at Castleton and Park; he suffered a severe head injury. “The requirements to operate a moped are like those for motorcycles,” the DMV says. “You must have a driver license and register your moped to drive it on streets and highways” (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=what-the-precinct-can-do-now>What the precinct can do now</h3><p>The map points to fixes we know: daylighting corners on Forest, Bay, Victory, Targee; hardened left turns and leading pedestrian intervals at the marked crosswalks where people keep getting hit; targeted failure-to-yield and speed enforcement during the afternoon peak and after dark when deaths spike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Trucks and buses are part of the harm; focus checks on heavy vehicles along these corridors, with follow-up for repeat violators (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, the path is straight. Use Sammy’s Law. Set a <strong>20 MPH default</strong> so fewer turns and impacts kill. Mandate speed limiters for the worst repeat offenders with the Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C). Both are ready to go; details and contacts are <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p><p>Council Member <a href=/council-district/49/>Kamillah Hanks</a> represents much of this precinct. In Albany, Assembly Member Charles Fall (<a href=/assembly-district/61/>AD 61</a>) and State Senator Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton (<a href=/senate-district/23/>SD 23</a>) are the votes that matter. The record here does not show whether they have sponsored the speed‑limiter bill. Will they back it? The deaths are in their districts.</p><p>Lower speeds. Safer turns. Focus on the hours and the corners that keep bleeding. One call can start it. Start <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
