The stories are worse.</p><p>On July 5th, Jeremy Claudio, 34, was riding his motorcycle on Bay Street. A Toyota SUV made a K-turn across traffic. Claudio hit the driver’s door. He died at the hospital. There were no arrests. The NYPD Collision Investigation Squad is still working the case. As <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>reported by amNY</a>, &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car on Staten Island during the Fourth of July holiday weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>In May, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. The impact threw the rider. Gomez-Guallazaca died from his injuries. No charges. No answers. According to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>, &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The dead do not get second chances.</strong></p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-rising>The Numbers: Relentless and Rising</h3><p><strong>In the last 12 months, Precinct 120 saw 4 deaths, 6 serious injuries, and 533 people hurt in 945 crashes.</strong> Children, elders, and workers. No one is spared. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—3 deaths and 160 pedestrian injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2 more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own trail of broken bodies.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has new speed limits and more cameras. But the streets are still deadly. The mayor and NYPD have crushed illegal mopeds and promised more enforcement. As <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>the mayor stated</a>, &ldquo;New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.&rdquo; But the dead keep coming. The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders, crack down on reckless turns, and protect crosswalks. They just need to use them.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-enforcement-and-real-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Enforcement and Real Change</h3><p><strong>Every crash is a policy failure.</strong> Call your council member. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement, safe crossings, and action at every hotspot. The next life lost could be someone you love.
