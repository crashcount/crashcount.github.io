It was just after midnight. The street was empty except for the bus and the boy. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>&ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus.&rdquo;</a> The boy did not get up. The bus driver and passengers walked away unhurt. The city calls it a collision. The family calls it something else.</p><p>A week before, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter died after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. His name was Nacere Ellis. He was hit, suffered head trauma, and never made it home. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Four people have died in Precinct 120 in the last year.</strong> Six hundred twenty-five have been hurt.

Her car hit another, airbags burst, blood spilled. Three fellow officers rode with her. All face discipline. Two more NYPD drunk-driving arrests followed. System failed. Streets paid.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2024-12-16) reports that NYPD Officer Diana Todaro was arrested for driving while intoxicated after crashing her car with three colleagues as passengers. The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
