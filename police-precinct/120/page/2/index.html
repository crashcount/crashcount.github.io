It was just after midnight. The street was empty except for the bus and the boy. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>&ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus.&rdquo;</a> The boy did not get up. The bus driver and passengers walked away unhurt. The city calls it a collision. The family calls it something else.</p><p>A week before, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter died after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. His name was Nacere Ellis. He was hit, suffered head trauma, and never made it home. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Four people have died in Precinct 120 in the last year.</strong> Six hundred twenty-five have been hurt.

They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-system-respondsor-doesnt>The System Responds—Or Doesn’t</h3><p>The police have the tools. They can ticket speeders, stop reckless drivers, and watch the corners where people die. They can enforce the law. They can slow the cars. But the streets stay fast. The crashes keep coming.</p><p>On Hylan Boulevard, confusion and bad signs have turned bus lanes into traps. Drivers make wrong turns, and <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane in order to make a right-hand turn.&rdquo;</a> The city knows. The borough president knows. Still, the signs stay up. The crashes keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-and-the-silence>The Leaders and the Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have the power to act. They can push for lower speed limits, safer crossings, and real enforcement. They can demand the NYPD crack down on reckless driving. They can fix the signs. They can make it stop. But the silence is thick. The waiting is long. The blood dries and the next crash comes.</p><p><strong>Precinct 120 is not a number. It is a wound that will not close.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call the precinct. Demand speed enforcement.

The driver crashed into a parked car and was arrested at the scene. Two guns were recovered from the vehicle. Both officers were hospitalized for injuries from broken glass.
