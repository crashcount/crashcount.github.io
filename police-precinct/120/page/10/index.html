In the last year, <strong>four people died</strong>. Over <strong>530 were injured</strong>. Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at 2 a.m. and the hush that follows.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed on College Avenue.</strong> The police said he suffered head trauma. The driver was 79. The boy&rsquo;s name was Nacere Ellis. No arrests. The case is still open. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.</a></p><p>In May, a man crossing Targee Street was struck by an e-scooter. He died at the hospital. The driver was thrown from the scooter. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma.</a></p><p>A motorcyclist died on Bay Street after a driver made a K-turn. The city keeps counting. The families keep counting.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The old and the young are not spared. In the last 12 months, 71 children were hurt. Twenty people over 65 were injured. Some never made it home.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras now run 24/7. The law lets New York set its own speed limits. But the default is still too high. The city has started to lower limits near schools, but most streets remain unchanged. The police can enforce the law. They can ticket speeders, reckless drivers, those who fail to yield. They can target the places where people die. But they must choose to act.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. They are the result of choices. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit everywhere. Demand enforcement where it matters. Demand streets where children can cross and live.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
