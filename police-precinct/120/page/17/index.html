Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong></p><p>Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street when an e-scooter struck him. The impact threw the rider. Gomez-Guallazaca died at Richmond University Medical Center. Police are still investigating. There have been no arrests. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>&ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A 68-year-old man was killed in a crosswalk at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place. The SUV driver failed to yield and turned left. The man died from head injuries. Another woman, 82, died at Bard Avenue and Forest Avenue. She was hit by an SUV. The driver was distracted. She never made it across.</p><h3 id=the-police-and-the-power-to-act>The Police and the Power to Act</h3><p>The police in Precinct 120 have the tools. They can enforce speed limits. They can ticket drivers who fail to yield. They can target crash hotspots. But the danger remains. <strong>Ten people have died here since 2022.</strong></p><p>Even the police are not spared. In March, two officers crashed their cruiser into a building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-crash-2-officers-recovering-crashing-police-cruiser-staten-island/16028315/>&ldquo;Another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>City leaders say they want zero deaths. They passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But the city has not yet acted. The law sits idle. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
