It was just after midnight. The street was empty except for the bus and the boy. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>&ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus.&rdquo;</a> The boy did not get up. The bus driver and passengers walked away unhurt. The city calls it a collision. The family calls it something else.</p><p>A week before, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter died after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson. His name was Nacere Ellis. He was hit, suffered head trauma, and never made it home. The driver stayed at the scene. No arrests.
