She did not survive Brooklyn traffic. &ldquo;She was the kindest, most generous person I’ve ever met,&rdquo; her grandchild said. A driver took her life as she crossed the street. She died of severe bleeding. (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>Gothamist</a>)</p><p>A 23-year-old man was hit at an intersection. Failure to yield. He suffered a head injury, bled out, and died. A 30-year-old, same story. A 39-year-old pedestrian died the same way, struck outside a crosswalk. A 57-year-old woman crossing with the signal was killed too. The rules did not save them.</p><p>A 63-year-old man crashed his SUV into a Queens garage. The structure collapsed on him. He did not survive. (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/01/21/suv-driver-63-dies-crashing-queens-garage-collapses-car>NY Daily News</a>)</p><p>A 53-year-old man died crossing where there was no signal. His injuries were crushing. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Seven dead in seven days. The new year is only weeks old, and already 14 people are gone. The mayor promised safer streets. Albany gave him the power to lower speed limits. He has not used it.</p><h3 id=the-toll-so-far>The Toll So Far</h3><p>This year, 5,411 crashes have left 2,960 people injured. 39 of them suffered serious injuries—amputations, paralysis, severe bleeding. 14 have died. The numbers are slightly better than last year, but tell that to the dead.</p><p>Speed cameras have helped. A report showed that in areas with cameras, &ldquo;tickets, accidents decline.&rdquo; One driver admitted, &ldquo;They tell you there’s a speed trap or speed camera and people will tend to be more cautious about it.&rdquo; (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/01/23/report--tickets--accidents-decline-due-to-speed-camera-program>NY1</a>)</p><p>Yet still, people die. Because in too many places, drivers go unchecked. Because our city moves slow when it comes to protecting life.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-inaction>The Cost of Inaction</h3><p>An Uber driver worked nights to be with his children during the day. Now those children have no father. &ldquo;He was a very, very nice dad,&rdquo; his widow said. His daughter, just seven years old, added: &ldquo;He was the best dad in the whole wide world.&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/01/22/uber-driver-died-queens-crash-worked-nights-spend-days-kids/>NY Daily News</a>)</p><p>These stories repeat. The losses mount. Every week, more names, more grief, more blood in the crosswalks.</p><h3 id=what-needs-to-happen>What Needs to Happen</h3><p>Lower the speed limits. Enforce them. Redesign the streets to protect people, not just move cars. The city has the power now. The mayor can act today. What you need to do now is <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>—before next week’s report brings more names, more funerals, more traffic violence.</p><div class="flex justify-between mv4"><a href=/carnage/2025-01-27-2025-01-13_to_2025-01-19/ class="link dim br2 ph3 pv2 ba b--black-10">← Four More Dead.
