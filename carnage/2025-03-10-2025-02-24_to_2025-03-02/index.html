A 26-year-old woman killed while riding in the front seat. A 17-year-old boy crushed behind the wheel. A 57-year-old cyclist thrown from his bike. A baby, too young to walk, struck while crossing with his family. The streets took them all.</p><p>This year, 38 people have died on New York’s roads. The city’s crash numbers are down, but serious injuries are up. The destruction is relentless. The pace slows, then quickens, but it never stops.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>Imani Vance was 26. She was riding in a Mercedes when the driver slammed into a school bus. He was unlicensed. He fled the scene. Her mother, Lakita Vance, is left with nothing but grief. “He killed my baby,” she said. “Imani was the light of the family.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/02/mercedes-driver-hit-with-manslaughter-charge-after-crashing-into-school-bus-in-brooklyn-killing-passenger/>She was the party</a>.

He was on his way to work when an <a href=#citations>off-duty firefighter</a> ran a red light, doing 83 mph in a 25 mph zone. The firefighter was drunk. The firefighter was high. Justin Diaz died in the hospital. His brother Franklin now speaks for him: “Thanks to Pena’s actions, Justin cannot live his dreams.”</p><p>A woman stepped out of a taxi in Boerum Hill and never made it across the street. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>The car that hit her</a> didn’t stop. No arrests have been made.</p><h3 id=solutions-ignored>Solutions Ignored</h3><p>The numbers should shame our leaders into action. They don’t. Albany gave New York the power to lower speed limits. The city hasn’t done it. The streets are still built for cars, not people. The blood keeps flowing.</p><p>“These statistics are outrageous,” said Assemblyman Smullen, whose son was killed in a crash. “They’re real people, real New Yorkers that are affected by this.” <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2025/02/26/n-y--lawmaker-unveils-bill-on-reckless-driving-awareness>He has chosen to act</a>.

Do it before next week’s body count.</p><h3 id=take-action>Take Action</h3><p>What you need to do now is <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>. Demand the city lower speed limits.
