Fewer crashes, fewer injuries. But six people still died last week. A 90-year-old woman, Frances Rickard, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>was hit by two cars</a> on the Upper East Side. The taxi driver made a U-turn and ran her down. She lived 90 years only to die in the street, waiting for an ambulance that wouldn&rsquo;t save her.</p><p>A 75-year-old man was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu/>crushed</a> while crossing with the light. Another pedestrian, 65, was hit at an intersection. A 61-year-old man lost his life in the roadway. And then there were the drivers. A young woman—27—died when her car <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>slammed into an underpass</a>. Another woman, just 40, was ejected when her Tesla <a href=#citations>flipped and burst into flames</a>. Police said it was going &ldquo;at least 120, 130 mph.&rdquo; The fire finished what the crash started.</p><h3 id=the-year-so-far-a-slow-motion-massacre>The Year So Far: A Slow-Motion Massacre</h3><p>It&rsquo;s early February. Already, 24 dead. Already, 57 seriously injured. The city celebrates a drop in crashes, but the dead don’t care about percentages. The families don’t care about statistics. Their mother, their father, their child is gone.</p><p>The trend is clear. Speeds are up. Consequences are brutal. The city lowered the speed limit once before. It worked. But Albany stalled Sammy’s Law for years, and now, even after it’s passed, the city hesitates. Meanwhile, the streets remain killing grounds.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next?</h3><p>The Department of Transportation made small changes. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/traffic_and_transit/2025/02/11/dot-modifies-third-avenue-traffic-light-timing-cyclist-safety>They adjusted the traffic lights</a> on Third Avenue for cyclists. A &ldquo;green wave.&rdquo; But one street, one change, isn’t enough. The dead don’t have time for incrementalism.</p><p>The city can act now. The mayor can lower the default speed to 20 mph. It wouldn&rsquo;t bring Frances Rickard back. It wouldn&rsquo;t heal crushed bones or burned bodies. But it would save the next one.</p><p>What you need to do now is <a href=../../take_action/>take action</a>. Demand the speed limit be lowered citywide. Stop the next death before it happens.</p><div class="flex justify-between mv4"><a href=../../carnage/2025-02-10-2025-01-27_to_2025-02-02/ class="link dim br2 ph3 pv2 ba b--black-10">← Another Week, Another Four Dead: NYC’s Streets Keep Killing
