A 73-year-old man, a 23-year-old man, a 70-year-old woman, and another 73-year-old man. Their names won’t make headlines. They are numbers in a grim tally: seven dead so far this year. Half as many as last year at this time, but still too many.</p><p>Speed. Distraction. Poor design. The causes are the same, the outcomes predictable. A woman crossing with the signal, struck down. A driver, losing control, never making it home. A pedestrian crushed at an intersection.</p><p>The MTA nearly lost a bus over a Bronx overpass last week. The driver swerved to avoid a double-parked car. The bus hit the wall. A few feet more, and dozens could have died. “I think it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules,” an official said. But enforcement is spotty, and the streets stay dangerous.

Four killed. The previous week was worse. The week before that, worse still. The numbers dip and rise, but the pattern stays the same.</p><p>A 92-year-old woman was crushed while getting off a vehicle. A 25-year-old driver lost his leg. A 71-year-old pedestrian suffered severe head wounds.</p><p>Speed cameras have helped, bringing crashes down. “Every four, five blocks is a camera,” one taxi driver complained. Another admitted, “People will tend to be more cautious about it.” Cameras work. Slowing cars saves lives.

The Will is Missing.</h3><p>We know what works. Lower speed limits. More enforcement. Better-designed streets. Protected bike lanes cut deaths on Queens Boulevard by 68%. London’s 20 mph limits slashed fatalities by 30%.</p><p>New York has the power now. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The city can drop speed limits to 20 mph. It hasn’t. Why?</p><p>The streets stay deadly while leaders hesitate. The blood spills while they wait.</p><p>What you need to do now is <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>. Demand the city lower speed limits. Demand they protect the lives of those who walk, bike, and ride. Seven dead this year.
